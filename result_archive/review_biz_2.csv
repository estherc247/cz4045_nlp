Decent place to grab lunch.,

Biggest gripe is you have to go to the counter and ask for a refill on your drink.",

"I usually visit this chick-fil-a at least 2-3 times a month because it is the closest to my house, but may be driving farther to go to a different location in the future.",the closest
The last three times I have visited (always through the drive-through),

"The last time I was here I had ordered a milkshake with no cherry as I am allergic to them (which I also said), drove up to the window, and was handed a milkshake with a cherry on it.",allergic to them -LRB- which I also said -RRB-
"When I gave it back and let them know it was supposed to no cherry, I watched the cashier through the window pick the cherry out with a napkin and cover up the leftover juice with whipped cream, then give it back to me.",
"After asking if it had been remade, the guy didn't know what to say and didn't answer me until I told him it needed to be remade and I had seen him just pick it out with a napkin.",

Seriously?,
So now we're again waiting for several minutes for the correct food after getting the wrong order.,
"The service as this chick-fil-a used to be great, but lately is seems like all of the workers are high school kids wanting to gossip and hang out without paying attention to helping customers or doing their job.",great
"Judging from the other recent yelp reviews, we're not the only people this has happened to.",
The service/management at this store really needs to get it together.,
"Every single time we have an issue especially in the drive thru.... they rush you when taking your order, cram all of your food in 1 bag, make your order incorrectly or forget parts of your order before pushing you through to get to the next person.",
I have tried to give them the benefit and go back but its a reoccurring issue.,
"

Last time I stopped and checked the order and with no surprise we were missing a sandwich - I went back in and spoke to a manager who was unapologetic and rude demanding a receipt when I had just pulled off the drive through, I explained this is a reoccurring issue and he directed me to the wall to get information if I would like to let the operator know.",unapologetic and rude
The management needs to get it together - Don't waste your time go to somewhere that cares about your business.,

After a long day at work and didn't feel like cooking dinner so I decided to pick up some Chick-Fil-A on my way home.,
I get there around 6:30 to a FULL drive-thru.,
After waiting almost 15mins in the drive-thru line alone I get to order and quickly get my food.,
I pull out of the plaza and stop less than a block away at a red light so I decide to check my food.,
I clearly noticed I had someone else's order because it was not even close to mine.,
I make and immediate u-turn and return to the still very long drive-thru line.,
I finally get to the order speaker and explain what happened.,
I'm asked to pull up to the window and a very youth and confused teenager tries to make it seem like I'm wrong because that's what I ordered and paid for like it said in the receipt.,wrong because that 's what I ordered and paid for like it said in the receipt

I ask her what about the difference between what I paid and what my correct order was because I noticed my correct order was less expensive.,less expensive
I told her I didn't need the change and asked if I could get a brownie to make up the difference they owed me + the hassle.,
"She quickly responded something like ""the brownie is $1.39 and the difference we owe you is only $.38 cents",
so you will have to pay the difference plus tax.,
""" I was shocked and lost for words at the awful customer service I was getting from one of my favorite fast food places.",shocked
After a few seconds of feeling like I was going to have a stroke from the anger I finally managed to ask for my $.38 cents back which she quickly gave to me.,
"Since I have yet to eat at any Chick-Fil-A
because my pride don't let me give a single penny to that company.",

We asked for 3 ranch and 3 chick-fil-a sauces with our meal.,
When we got up to the pay window the girl informed me that we'd have to pay for the extra sauces (they only give you 2).,
"Ok, no problem.",
But then she rolls her eyes and gives me the snottiest attitude about it.,
"She says """,
"yeah, it's because, you know, people like this (me) who order to much sauce"".",

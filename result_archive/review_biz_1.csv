"1st off, I do like this joint.",
 Sunday brunch in my area is non-existent,non-existent
so I came for the buffet.,
" Waitress was not around to greet me so I took off to get my breakfast, because she didn't greet me I didn't get to find out that becasue of my age I could have gotten my meal for $10.99 instead of $12.99, I'm older than 55.",older
 I should have forgotten to leave her a gratuity.,
"
Sausage, bacon, hash brown bake were good, biscut-gravy and scrambled eggs  not so much.","brown, good, so much"
" Over by the omlette station they have waffels, those were a great way to end the meal.",
 Next time I'll have the chef make me an omlette.,
"
If you can eat both breakfast and lunch at the same time, they offer ribs and mac and cheese.",
Tucked away behind a bridge in an awkward business plaza or something sits this cute little cafe.,
Came in on a Sunday where they apparently have a limited menu and a $12 brunch buffet.,
"
",
We decided to go with the buffet and walked away feeling money well spent.,
The food quality in this clean establishment was above part and we'll prepared.,
Standing behind the active station was a friendly older gentleman preparing your perfectly put together omelet.,perfectly put together
Tip the man please because he deserves it and seems like he couldn't be happier to put together your omelet.,happier
For the waffles they offer homemade peach and blackberry compote to dress over your waffle.,
"Can't speak for the peach, but the blackberry was delicious.",delicious
Tasted fresh and not too sweet.,"fresh, too sweet"
"Happy we found this place, and hope you will too.",
"Good food, poor service.",
I waited 20 or 30 mins before I could give my name.,
I had to go up to someone working and tell them ..,
there did not seem to be a hostess yet it said please wait to be seated...,
everyone waiting seemed to be confused.,
"We were seated in the ""added on"" room which didn't have any of the decor like the main room.",added on
A buffet was going on for a children's birthday party so the atmosphere was not what I hoped.,
Perhaps I came on an off day.,
The waitress was nice and I did enjoy my plate of food.,nice
I've been here twice now for brunch.,
Each time I'm a bit amazed at how good the food really is for a small town place tucked in near the train tracks.,how good
"

I went a la carte on my last visit and ordered a pancake, sausage patties, hash browns, and a side of fruit.",la
"I figured they would all be super small side portions, but boy was I wrong.",
They were very generous with the plating and I couldn't finish all of my food.,very generous with the plating
"

",
The pancake was delicious and looked so tempting that my friend had to sneak a taste too and agreed.,"delicious, so tempting"
It was a fluffy disc the size of a large plate with a dollop of whipped butter on the top.,
"It's probably a dish you can recall from memory of a past experience, but this pancake still exceeded my expectations.",
The maple syrup mixed in with the melted butter to create a wonderful balance of decadent sweetness.,decadent
"

If you're looking to order a dish straight off the menu, I would recommend the Spanish Omelette.",
Cheesy eggs and meat together with a little bit of spice.,
What's not to love?,not to love
A note to spice wimps that the dish is not too hot on the scale.,too hot on the scale
"

Let there be a warning that service is fairly slow here.",fairly slow
"If you're someone that often needs a refill of coffee or water, this probably isn't the place for you.",
"

Most servers are friendly at least, but one of the women that runs food orders is not only not helpful, but is rude and dismissive.","friendly, not helpful, rude and dismissive"
"I tried to politely ask about the side of fruit that I ordered and was missing from the table, and she rudely said the other woman would bring it and walked away.",
"My server then came out, but there was still no side of fruit.",
I had to kindly ask again for my order.,
"My server quickly fixed this issue, but the other woman had the first opportunity to correct the order and dismissed me.",
"

All in all, I deducted a star for service, but it's a place I'd go to again if I was in the area.",
At least I know that I'll get a pretty good meal if nothing else.,pretty good
We work at MetroPet Veterinary Clinic just down the road in Berea.,

Just went by here with my husband on our way home.,
"We were expecting a coffee shop, but it feels more like a diner.",
The food that we've had so far is great!,great
(Eggs benedict and the caprice flat bread),
The iced vanilla latte is also pretty good.,pretty good
"It definitely does not have the atmosphere of a cafe, but this is likely because it is so large!","likely, so large"
Might need to come back when it is a little busier to see how it is then.,a little busier
Could not have been any better!!,
  ,
Terry preparing the omelette and waffles literally tripped over himself to help us and explain the Sunday brunch etc.,
 Recently moved to Berea and this was our second visit.,
 Both visit everyone was very polite and helpful.,very polite and helpful
 This is on our list of new hangouts.,
 Waitress (Kim) very efficient and kind as well.,very efficient and kind

"Service at first was prompt, we were seared right away 9:30 on a Saturday morning the place was almost full.","prompt, almost full"
"I ordered eggs Benedict , and biscuits and gravy.",
My wife got bourbon peach French toast.,
First off ( in my best Donald Trump voice) the portions were YUGE!!.,YUGE
Sadly the eggs Benedict was a flavorless mess.,flavorless
"It was not played well, just kind of slopped all over the plate with a watery absolutely flavorless yellow something I would not even recognize as hollandaise sauce on top.",absolutely flavorless
The biscuit gravy was delicious but when brought out had that not so nice under the  heat lamp  too long crust on it.,"delicious, not so nice under the heat lamp too long"
"Had our server ever come back around to say, refill our coffee, or ask about our food I would have returned it.",
The biscuits were obviously store bought mush.,
My wife's only response was meh.,
Obviously canned peaches and just okay.,
One and done.,One
They have brunch!!,
Next time we'll plan better!,
" We just came in for a mid-morning snack & tea/coffee - the Sunday brunch looks fabulous, with omelet bar all for $12.99!",fabulous

We went today for Father's Day brunch and had reservations.,
I have a 2 year old and requested a high hair.,2 year old
Well we got there and had to wait over 10 min,
and then they didn't have a high chair for my daughter.,
I think they only have 2 in the whole place.,
"We literally 
stood there for a good 5 min waiting before we finally sat down and our waitress finally came over and asked if we needed anything",
and I said yes we need a highchair,
and they were still supposedly looking for one.,
She brought over another chair and I looked at her,
and I said my daughter is 2 that is not going to work.,
She did apologize but offered us no other alternative.,
We were finally offered coffee and some beverages a good 10 minutes after we got there.,
Our service overall was subpar.,subpar
My daughter had to sit on my husband's lap or my lap because we never did get a highchair!!!!,
After over an hour I did see that I highchair finally became available and they never even offered to see if we needed it at that point!,available
It overall seem like they were overstaffed and completely unprepared for the amount of people although I know that they've had Father's Day and Mother's Day brunch is before so it's not like they didn't know that this amount of people were going to be there!,"overstaffed, completely unprepared"
The food was okay,okay
I'm just really upset by the customer service.,really upset by the customer service

 Looked very unprofessional.,very unprofessional
Then I wanted to switch the meat that came with my food to fruit.,

"About 1/2 later and 25 or so ""I'm hungry's"" from the kids, our name was called.",
We told the lady who sat us that we wanted the buffet and she mumbled someone would be with us soon to get our order.,
"Finally after about 5 minutes I sent my wife and kids up to get food and waited to ""place our order"" for buffets.",
The waitress came by and was sweet as pie and took our drink order and explained what was on the buffet.,sweet as pie
"Looking around, she was the ONLY waitress who had a smile on her face and looked like she wanted to be alive that day.",alive
"Onto the food... they have a great spread including made-to-order omelets, fresh waffles, bacon, sausage, french toast, potatoes, biscuits and sausage gravy, fruit, muffins and dessert.",made - to - order
The older gentleman who was making the eggs and waffles was amazing and put on a show for my daughter who wanted to go back up for seconds on her omelet.,amazing
The eggs were fluffy and he didn't skimp on the ingredients.,fluffy
The waffles were to die for and the gravy for the biscuits was very tasty.,very tasty
I didn't care much for the potatoes or bacon/sausage but overall it was a very good meal for $14.95 per person  ($6.99 for kids) but the service was just ok.,"much for the potatoes or bacon / sausage, very good, just ok"
"Like I said, we had a great waitress and the omelet guy was friendly, but the greeters, the ladies serving coffee at the front desk and the rest of the wait staff didn't seem to want any part of customers.",friendly
"We may try this again because I love a good, tasty breakfast buffet, but with other options it won't be our go-to place.",
Yet.,
Really nice out of the way place with a great breakfast menu with fresh ingredients and a coffee bar.,Really nice out of the way place with a great breakfast menu with fresh ingredients and a coffee bar .

"
I did find the fact that they have breakfast sandwiches pretty unique and even though I didn't get one personally, I heard the Jo Jo was delightful.","pretty unique, delightful"
"Now for the stuff I didn't care for...
",
There was a guy doing construction work near the bathroom the whole time we were there.,
"So instead of a music ambiance, we had power tools.",
"Why they scheduled that during business hours is beyond me and if I hadn't had a six person party coming from all different directions to get together, I would have left.",
It's really distracting trying to talk to people when that's going on.,
Also the tea I had wasn't very good.,very good
I realize it's not their fault when all they have is bagged tea,
but I do appreciate a larger selection if that's what you're going to serve.,
"The food and service was ok, nothing to write home about but definitely good for the plain breakfast mood when you're sick of Bob Evans.","ok, sick of Bob Evans"
"Honestly, there could have been a very good reason for the construction work even though they didn't bother to explain.",very good

We waited another 10-15 minutes before I asked for a server.,
"The person I asked did take our order and was going to bring us water and coffee, another 12 min goes by",
and I ask another server for coffee and water.,
 She brought it one minute.,

Yummy.,
 I had the choice of home fries or fresh tomato slices as my side.,

"Now, I did read the Yelp reviews posted on this site before I went.",
 Because I have heard so many positive comments from friends about Perk Cup Cafe I decided that we would give it a try.,so many
 Our experience was nothing like the reviews I read.,
 There were plenty of busy and friendly waitresses.,busy and friendly
 The place was nearly full with lots of chatter from young to old.,"nearly full with lots of chatter, old"

P.S.  I have been told that their weekend brunch is a must try.",
 We will be going!,
Worst customer service ever!,
Wasn't even that busy and didn't get greeted at the door.,
Was getting gossiped about by employees.,
My friend ordered bottomless mimosas.,
I attached a pic so you can see the actual definition.,
And it took 20 minutes for her to get another mimosa.,
"Wasn't given napkins, and when seated first time they were putting us to a occupied table so had to wait another 20 minutes.",
"They try to make it seem like we were the problem, actually it's the way you run your restaurant.",

Who has ever done that before?,
Let me say that the food here is really good but the service is slow and at times chaotic.,"really good, slow"

Servers run around like chickens with their heads cut off.,
They have no order or process for what they do which is a shame because the food is worth it.,worth

I have gotten different combos and it's nice to be able to have it the way you want it.,able to have it the way you want it

 ,
"Recently I went to get breakfast after church and after a 15 minute wait for a table which was expected I noticed other tables were crossed off their ""wait list"" that came in after us.",
 I get it that they would like to sit 4 people at a 4 person table,
but I really do not want to wait until one of their little 2 person tables opens up so we can be jammed into it.,
" Once again, I get it...",
I do not expect to be put at a 6 or 8 person table because that would be weird for 2 people.,weird for 2 people
"

After being seated we waited 5-10 minutes for a waitress to stop and take our drink order which she brought promptly back but would return to take our breakfast order.",
 Fast forward 25-30 minutes (I eventually put a timer on my phone as I was getting aggravated) another waitress stopped by and told us that there must have been a mix up.,Fast forward 25 - 30
" We ordered 4 over easy eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, and toast.",
" Fast forward a second time for another 30 minutes; we have not been checked on, I ran out of coffee, and the table seated at the same time we were had received their food, ate, and were signing their bill.",
" After the strenuous feat of flagging down the waitress that took our order but was not her table, we asked for a bill for the coffee and told her we were leaving because we had a prior obligation we needed to attend.",
" She seamed very put off that after spending over an hour to attempt to order 4 eggs (only half cooked so it should have been easier), a couple strips of bacon, hashbrowns, and toast; she told us ""its fine, don't worry about the coffee bill"".","easier, fine"
 And no apology offered.,
"

But seriously...  This is average breakfast food.",
" 4 eggs, a couple strips of bacon, hashbrowns, and toast???",
 Why didn't that just take it off of the buffet?,
 We could see giant piles of this in their roasters.,
But then again it would have been $15 per person if it came from the buffet.,
"

This is the first time we have ever walked out of a restaurant without eating.",
"We've eaten here several times, mostly because it's like five minutes away.",
" The food is pretty much average, though I do like the Farmer's Market English muffin sandwich.",pretty much

" The food is passable, so if you don't mind mediocre food and slow service, this is the place for you.",passable
" Also, they only offer a limited menu on Sunday mornings, since they have the breakfast buffet then, so we haven't gone back there on a Sunday since we found that out........",

 The replacements were a little better but still pretty tough.,"a little better, pretty tough"
(Note to cafe:  maybe the pancake batter needs refreshed with baking powder or stirred less?  This should result in a better pancake.),
 I opted for the blackberry topping over the Mrs. Butterworth's syrup.,
" Great choice, topping had lots of blackberries.",
 Now for my Tea Rant:  Hot tea drinkers will get this.,
 Two things ruin a hot tea experience.,
 First is contaminated water.,contaminated
" Water is contaminated when they use containers that previously held coffee, resulting in coffee tasting tea.",coffee tasting
"Perk-cUp Cafe does NOT have contaminated tea water, but they hit on my other hot tea nerve.",
 The second is tea refills.,
" We were charged the same price for both coffee and tea, $1.89 each.",
 Husband got his hot coffee and even a refill pot was placed on the table for his convenience.,
 I got a tea bag and carafe of hot water.,
" When server offered a refill, she wanted to charge me another $1.89 for a second tea bag.",
What?,
Husband gets a whole pot of coffee on the table?,
Coffee is way more expensive than tea.,way more expensive than tea
"Anyway, she did give me a 2nd tea bag, this time, only because I had a problem with the pancakes.",
 (another note to cafe:  Rethink the policy of charging for a 2nd tea bag.,
 Do you charge for refills on pop or iced tea?),
 End Rant.,
"
I like supporting locally owned restaurants and will most likely return for lunch sometime.",locally owned
" The menu offered many different sandwiches, salads, and soups.",
" If I went for breakfast though, I would skip the pancakes.",

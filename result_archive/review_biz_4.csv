I took a seat at the bar.",
Solid craft beer list that included a couple offerings from Double Wing Brewing that is underrepresented in downtown Cleveland.,
I asked the bartender what to order and she recommended the sporaccii sandwich.,

"The sandwich had jalapeno cheddar sausage, loads of pulled pork and slaw on soft butter rolls and came with a side of their housemade bbq sauce - vinegar based with a little tang and a little spice.",

Tasty, meaty addition to Cleveland!",

"Our server was taking our orders, and as he turned away from my husband to take my order, the manager said to our server ""So I heard you came in a little late today, huh?""",

"We were seated promptly at a 6-person booth for only  the two of us, when the restaurant was relatively empty.",relatively empty

"We ordered the mama bear which had 1/2 lb of each meat - ribs, pork and brisket.",
Then we ordered the jalapeño cheddar sausage el jefe style.,
"That just came with guac, jalapeños and a couple tortillas.",
I liked all the meats except I did not care for the sausage.,
I did however loved the tortilla that came with it,
and I wanted more.,
"

We were going to get the papa bear originally but then noticed that the price was more expensive than ordering the maps bear and the jalapeño sausage separate plus you got to choose a different style and got the awesome tortillas!",separate
"

There was an issue with the price when we got the check and the waiter corrected the issue.",
I guess they changed their menu and forgot to change the price of the sausage in the computer as well.,
Been back numerous times now.,

Added a great fried chicken.,
Love it!,

" The poutine was first it was a huge portion plenty for 3 maybe 4 people, it had a very nice gravy, fries were great and the house pickles i could eat a jar or 2 of them.","very nice, great"
 My only complaints with it was it was a touch on the salty side,
and there was almost a half inch of cheese on top that had to be cut with a knife (more is not always better) it took away from the other flavors of the poutine.,better
" Mains came out shortly after my meat plate had a very generous portion of all the meats i ordered, mac looked very good and it also came with more house pickles :)  pickled red onions and sweet pickled jalapeno","very generous, very good"

 Make the drive and try them out!!,

We loved the food and he was very accommodating and friendly.,"very accommodating, friendly"
We enjoyed our experience and would come back to see Austin.,
Well I (sadly) must agree with the majority of reviewers on this place.,
I'm sure (meaning I hope) that things will improve as they continue on,sure
but my first visit today for lunch was overall pretty disappointing.,pretty disappointing
"First off, lets take about the AC.",
The dining room felt like a meat locker and everyone who had a sweater or jacket was wearing it inside the dining room.,
This makes for an uncomfortable experience before you even have anything to eat or drink.,
"Had the pulled pork, jalapeno cheddar sausage and corn bread.",
The pork was of good quality but pretty flavorless.,pretty flavorless
No bark or burnt ends.,
"They have 3 sauces you can add, all were OK, not great, but you shouldn't have to.","OK , not great"

The corn bread was quite good.,quite good
"As others have stated, too many staff who kept trying to remove our plates before we were done.",too many
For a BBQ place at this price point with this kind of foodie pedigree it was quite a disappointment.,

 I am not a huge meat eater but was pleasantly surprised which the BBQ on my first visit.,pleasantly surprised
 I commented to the waitress that the food was quite a bit better than Michael Symon's bbq joint Mabels downtown.,a bit better
 The food on the second and third visits was just as good however there are some improvements to be had otherwise.,"second and third, as good"
 The restaurant is situated right on the road so the entrance is on the back by the parking lot and is a rather awkward.,a rather awkward

" Cute hanging lights over the booths are illuminated with awful ""environmentally friendly"" bulbs that are so bright it is almost painful to look at the person across from you.","environmentally friendly, almost painful"
 Similar lights in the bar area appear to use old fashioned filament bulbs which are much more appropriate.,"old fashioned, much more appropriate"
 The lighting over the booths is so awful we had to ask for them to be dimmed which they did for about five minutes before turning them up again to full capacity!,so awful we had to ask for them to be dimmed which they did for about five minutes before turning them up again to full capacity
 It really makes for an unpleasant dining experience.,
" In addition, the wait staff could use some additional training.",
 Often water glasses are left unfilled.,
 During two of our meals our waitress changed during the meal and the new waitress got our orders incorrect.,incorrect

Both dishes were top notch.,
"Well seasoned, appropriately tender, and full off smoked flavor.","seasoned, full off smoked flavor"
"Each dish was also served with guacamole and salsa on the side, giving the food a southwestern flair if desired.",
As a side dish I had the cornbread which was served in a cast iron pan warm out of the oven.,warm out

I topped off my meal with the chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich composed of fresh soft giant cookies around a layer of creamy vanilla ice cream.,
A+.,

After talking to the manager, Eric, who was extremely friendly and helpful, my wife and I learned the head cook was from Texas.",extremely friendly and helpful
After hearing this fact everything made sense.,
Good BBQ comes from Texas and now exists in Cleveland with its own twists.,

The service however was a bit slow.,a bit slow
Go give it a try.,

" Drinks are drinks and service is service, but the food makes all of the difference.",
" I have heard some people complain about various aspects, but it all comes down to the food.",
" I have never been a smoked meat guy, mostly because it is so hard to perfect.",so hard
 There is usually too much smoke and that's all I can taste.,too much
"However, at Smokin' Q's, it tastes like the smoke was meant to be there and occurred naturally.",
I don't know how to describe it any better.,any better
 It was fantastic.,fantastic
 I read that someone thought the mac-and-cheese was runny?  ,runny
They must have brought that in from their home because the mac-and-cheese I got was thick and fantastic!,thick and fantastic
 The brisket cannot be beat.,
 I recommend this place to everyone that is looking for BBQ or just looking for a cool place to have a drink.,
" The patio is great, as long as it isn't too humid outside.",great
 I have eaten there and had food to go several times and it has never disappointed!!,
" Try it, you'll love it!",
We heard the longtime Fisher' Tavern was to be remodeled into a new place a few months ago.,
Later we learned it would be a BBQ spot and just recently found it would be connected to the Quagliata family of restaurants.,
The result is a fine new interior with a pleasant assemblage of foods.,
"

Smokin' Q's meats are a touch spicier than most of the BBQ spots opening in Cleveland.",a touch spicier
"The sauce (on each table in a pedestrian plastic bottle with a masking tape label handwritten, ""Sauce"") is calmer.",
The result is a richer meat flavor and we found ourselves using less sauces.,
The Brisket was excellent (remember to order a mix and chop those slices for a better taste!),excellent
"and while I thought the Pulled Pork was a touch dry, my wife enjoyed it fully.",a touch dry
Liked the Potato Salad and Lettuce Wedge as well.,
What was interesting is that the entrée was available Traditional or with Tortillas.,"interesting, available Traditional"
This was a clever twist and one will likely try next visit.,
"

I noticed a number of lower ratings here, likely due to the cost.",
This is among the costlier BBQ spots in Cleveland.,costlier
"I can't give the food bad marks, but would advise prospective diners to check out the menu and understand your tab in advance.",
I loved the atmosphere of this restaurant.,
There were all sorts of western decorations and BBQ themed items on the walls.,
"I had the pulled pork, it was a little dry but still delicious.","a little dry, still delicious"
"The brisket was the best meat we ordered, I would go back for just that!",
The entrees come with pickles which were awesome.,awesome
The homemade bread made the meal.,

We sat at the bar and had a very attentive and personable bartender serving us.,very attentive and personable
"My wife and I shared a Mama's combo which included ribs, brisket and pulled pork.",
"The ribs were excellent, the pulled pork was OK though a bit dry, and the brisket was quite dry.","excellent, a bit dry, quite dry"
The sauces were above average.,
The mac & cheese was excellent.,excellent
Portions were fine.,fine
"I did not think that the food prices were out of line for the quality and quantity, though it seems a small piece of cornbread could come with the combo dinners rather than providing an indescript ""brioche"" roll.",
They do have to reduce the price on their draft beer.,
I don't think any other high-end restaurant in the Cleveland area charges nine dollars for a microbrew draft.,
"Since barbecue and beer go together, they are going to chase away a lot of customers with those beer prices.",
"They will be competing with Oak and Embers in Chesterland and right now, I would likely go to Oak and Embers.",
I will however give this place another try after the management has a chance to tweak things.,
Woohoo!  Another fun local BBQ joint has opened.,
I'm liking this trend.,
 I have been here a few times since opening week.,
 Each visit I've noticed that they have been making changes in a good way.,
 One of the most recent changes include lunch specials.,most recent
 Thank you for doing that because most customers don't want to spend over $20 on lunch.,

I've had most of the meat offerings including the brisket, pulled pork, baby back rib and sausage.",
 What stands out?,
The ribs for sure.,sure
" Seasoned well with a nice peppery bark, meaty and tender.",Seasoned

I'm liking what I'm seeing so far.",
 Offering daily specials unique from their regular menu.,

 Happy hour beer specials and a nice atmosphere.,
We tried it yesterday for the first time.,
 We love barbeque.,
 We ate outside.,
 The outside patio is noisy as heck from car traffic.,noisy as heck from car traffic
" There's plenty of room behind the deck, build another one farther from the road.",
 The meat did not fall off the bone as they said it would.,
 The ribs were tough.,tough
" My son had a chicken sandwich, very dry.",very dry
 Sadly don't recommend.,
We had a mixed experience on a recent trip here.,
 Lets start with the most important part the food.,most important
The beef ribs and spare ribs were really good.,really good
 Both had the bark and smoke flavor you expect from a smokehouse and were tender without being mushy.,mushy
" The biggest surprise was the pureed sweet potatoes, they were awesome.",awesome
 The sausage and mac and cheese were good as well.,good
" 
The brisket and burnt ends were a huge disappointment.",
 Both lacked any bark or smoke flavor and you if i wasnt in a bbq smokehouse it wouldnt have occurred to me that they were smoked.,
 The burnt ends werent even 'burnt',
and i question if they were even smoked a second time.,
" The beans were different, not bad but not what we were expecting as it was more like a soup.","different, bad"
"
Our server was friendly and helped us with our questions.",friendly
" Since we just ordered bbq, i was surprised that it took 30+ min to get our food.",surprised
 They were busy but since the bbq is already cooked it should come out faster,busy
Have been to this place four times.,
The sliced brisket has been fatty all three times I had it.,fatty
They seem to forget parts of your order.,
Forgot bbq sauce the second time and the fourth time our corn bread.,
Funny thing is I repeated my order twice and the person taking my order did too.,
When I picked up my order and asked if the corn bread was in the bag she said yes.,
I get home and only one slice corn bread.,
"When I called to ask if they could add it to the next time I come in, planning on ordering take out again.",
She said said ok.,ok
Then she calls me back and said I didn't pay for it and I would have to pay if I get another.,
"I was planning on paying for it when I ordered two, but they messed up my order.",
Looking for another bbq place.,
Not at all impressed.,
I love BBQ and yes know the difference between smoked meat BBQ and Famous Daves.,Famous
Meat was fatty waitress terrible drinks to expensive.,expensive
Side dishes expensive and not very good.,"expensive, not very good"
 Don't plan on returning until waitress learns not to argue with customers.,
I guess nothing else to ad.,else to ad
I was looking forward to the opening as I've been a customer of Fisher's Tavern for many years.,
"However, I had a very disappointing experience.",very disappointing
The menu was very limited and the pricing was too high for the quantity and quality of the food.,"very limited, too high for the quantity and quality of the food"
I had a cheese and fajita dip appetizer that was soupy with very little fajita makings in it.,very little
The chips were thick and tasteless.,thick and tasteless
My friend's pulled brisket sandwich was very small in size for the price and the french fries were an extra cost!,very small in size for the price
"I would have liked a cocktail, but they were all too pricey.",too pricey
"Unless pricing, food quality, quantity and choices change, I won't be coming back.",
Really disappointed!,Really disappointed !
We ordered 2 dinners Beef Rib ($36 for a single bone) and  Brisket.,
"Brisket was ok, had a good bark but not at all seasoned.",ok
"Beef Rib was totally unseasoned,  and tastes as if it was reheated.",totally unseasoned
We actually threw away that $36 .,
Ordered a variety of sides.,
"Fried corn was good, sweet potatoes were ok.","good, ok"
Mac and cheese was very good and fries were oily and old.,"very good, oily and old"
This was on their second day of business which is why I'll be nice with 3 stars.,nice with 3 stars
I'll give em a couple months and try again to update the review for better or worse.,better or worse
But for a restaurant to serve obviously old and unseasoned food on one of there opening days in I acceptable.,"obviously old and unseasoned, acceptable"
It's smoked bbq for God's sake!,
Step it up people.,
I'm surprised Carl Quigliata would allow this to happen,surprised
We both ordered baby back ribs.,
"They were under cooked, clearly not slow cooked.",slow cooked
Seemed like they were precooked and reheated.,
There were hard to get off the bone without a knife.,hard to get off the bone without a knife
What ever happened to falling off the bone?,
They need a real pit master that has some experience doing ribs.,
"If you can't get the ribs right at a barbecue spot, that is not a good sign.",
In fairness the corn bread was very good and the barbecue sauce was also good.,"very good, good"
Unfortunately brioche bun was dry and uninteresting.,dry and uninteresting
There are other much better barbecue spots in town.,much better
"Hopefully these folks get it figured out, it is hard to go back after a very mediocre experience.",very mediocre
"Even though the manager asked how we liked everything, it was quickly apparent he was only open to positive feedback.",only open to positive feedback
 If you don't want the truth please don't ask.,
Food was not prepared at all good....,all good
no smoking flavor.,
Sides are overpriced.,overpriced
There are better places to get BBQ,
But for a restaurant to serve obviously old and unseasoned food on one of there opening days is unacceptable.,"obviously old and unseasoned, unacceptable"
Had a great dinner last night.,
Started with the brisket poutine as an appetizer and it was sooooo good.,good
"Got a 3 meat mix with chicken, pork ribs and sausage and a brisket with tips and slices with a side of baked bean cassoulet so we could try a wide variety",
and we were not disappointed.,disappointed
The beans were amazing.,amazing
Next time we bring more people to share the appetizer so we don't end up bringing half our meals home.,
Brisket and scrambled eggs this morning ;),
I always read the yelp reviews but this time I chose to ignore them for a variety of reasons.,
" Smokin Q's is less than a mile from my home, I love barbecue and have fond memories of the old Fishers Tavern.",
So l could not wait to try it.,
 Met a friend for lunch on the deck.,
" At first glance, was impressed with the renovation.",impressed with the renovation
 Liked the openness but could not help but notice how dirty the floor was.,
 Sugar pack wraps etc.,
all over.,
" Whatever, we ate outside.",
 Our waitress clearly hates her job.,
 Not a hint if a smile or any effort to do anything than the bare minimum.,
 Had to track her down to place our order.,
 I had the fat hefer  and my friend had the shrimp tacos.,
" What little meat there was on my bun was dry, dry, dry!","dry , dry , dry"
My friend's lunch was so bad she only had a few bites.,so bad she only had a few bites
 The presentation was poor.,poor
 Wish I had taken a picture of our lunches.,
 Waitress came and got our paid checks while we were still sitting there!,
"Never said a word, just picked them up and left.",
 Never had that happen before.,
So sorry I left her a tip.,
"Passed the manager in the hallway as we were leaving, he looked right at us and never said a word.",
" No ""Thank you for coming or How was your food?.",
""" Nothing.  It is clear these people do not want you coming to their restaurant.",clear these people do not want you coming to their restaurant
 I will gladly accommodate them and stay far away.,
" Too bad, because I really wanted to make this a regular spot in my neighborhood.",Too bad
They trying to hard to be a Texas bbq.,
To much rub.,
Can not taste the ribs.,
Corn bread was over spiced and took away from what could have been flavorful  Certainly not a good representation of good Texas style BBQ.,"over spiced, flavorful"
"The food was fine, certainly didn't live up to the hype but it was good.","fine, good"
I felt like the baby back ribs were tough and the brisket wasn't really that smokey or memorable either.,"tough, memorable"
Mac and cheese was very very good.,very very good
"I feel that I should mention that our server Sarah had the absolute worst breath that I have ever smelled on a person, made me not want to eat anything, it was really really really bad-",really really bad
but all in all I would go back,
If there was a zero star rating I would have put it.,
This is one of the worst restaurants I've been to.,
The first time I went here I thought it was nice at first.,nice at first
"But that's where the positive ends, right after we were seated at our table.",
The restaurant was very cold even though it was the winter and the hostess was quite rude.,"very cold, quite rude"
I understand that it was quite busy that day but almost everyone that was there had already ordered when we got there.,quite busy
So why exactly did we wait a good 40 minutes to order drinks.,
DRINKS!,
NOT actual FOOD but DRINKS.,
"Mind you we went at around 7, which is later than the usually dinnertime rush.",usually dinnertime
"Also, while looking at the menu I found nothing that I liked.",
There was no really basic food (I'm more of a simple plain cheeseburger kind of person when ordering at restaurants) except for on the lunch menu.,"really basic, more"
So I ordered dessert.,
"Yes, I actually hated the options on the menu THAT much that I ordered a brownie with ice cream on top for dinner.",THAT much
So then we finally were able to order our food and then we waited another hour until the food was served to us.,able to order our food
"Now if we had had a large party then maybe, MAYBE, I would understand the long wait.",
But it was only for four people.,
"If you recall I ordered a desert, which was disgusting.",disgusting
The brownie was overly hot and the ice cream was soup on top of the brownie.,overly hot
Everyone else's food was pretty disgusting and my dad's chicken wings were also UNDER COOKED.,pretty disgusting
At the end of our meal the manager was circling the restaurant making sure that everyone was satisfied.,"sure, satisfied"
My father told him about it and the nice man took off the cost of the chicken wings.,
So we figured that we wouldn't go there again.,
But then just a few weeks ago we decided to go there again because we wanted to go out to celebrate school being out for summer.,out
We decided to get outdoor seats since it was a nice evening and we didn't want to have to deal with the overly air conditioned indoor seating.,air conditioned
But the waitress placed us at a table with the sun beating directly into our eyes even though there were two other tables that were in the shade and had umbrellas.,
We asked the waitress to put us at another table and she did so with no attitude so we had hope for this visit.,
Sadly it turned dour AGAIN when we waited about the same wait to order and get served as we did the previous time.,
"The hostess had very long hair that was just down, which I thought was interesting that they didn't make her put it up in a pony like they would do in most workplaces.","very long, interesting"
So when she served our drinks her hair went right into my brothers drink.,
We all ordered the same burger.,
And the burger was burnt to a crisp and tasted pretty bad.,pretty bad
"Plus we had fries as a side to our burgers and there was no ketchup on the table just hot sauce and BBQ sauce, which was odd because that is a pretty standard condiment to have at a restaurant.","odd, pretty standard"
In the end we will NEVER EVER got to this place again.,
Sorry for the long review I just feel very strong about this place.,"Sorry, very strong about this place"
I definitely would not recommend.,
Also there was really nothing on the menu for kids,
so it's not really an ideal family place.,
Giving this restaurant experience a one star is being kind.,
This was a weekday evening out with another couple.,
"Each of us ordered different entrees, ribs, brisket, chicken and perch, all equally bad.",equally bad
 Ribs and brisket were extremely fatty real artery cloggers.,
 Chicken was dry and perch was 90% greasy burnt breading.,dry
" Our wait for food was over one hour and the waitress could only say"" we're short staffed in the kitchen"".",
The wait would not of been bad if the atmosphere was conducive to enjoy an evening out without having to scream to talk.,"bad, conducive to enjoy an evening out without having to scream to talk"
Probably one of the noisiest restaurants I have ever been in EVER.,
 Simply put horrible horrible horrible.,horrible horrible horrible
Dry and bland.,
Super disappointing.,disappointing
Don't waste your time.,
This area needs better restaurants and this unfortunately isn't one of them.,
The only thing tasty was the pickles - not enough for a return visit.,tasty
"I'm not one to give bad reviews when unwarranted, but it was stunning how bad and overpriced this place was.","unwarranted, stunning, bad and overpriced"
"I heard from some others that the food was mediocre, but thought to myself that those people really weren't ""BBQ people"" and it simply wasn't their type of place.",mediocre
" As someone that lives right around the corner and loves BBQ, I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt.",
" 

Really disappointed.",Really disappointed .
 Priced for high end BBQ with low end quality.,
 This place doesn't even compete with most places in town.,
 I really hope they turn it around or else that place won't survive long.,
It's really a shame...,
they put tons of work into making the old Fishers look great.,great
Only saving grace was White Raja IPA was listed as on tap unfortunately ....,White Raja IPA was listed as on tap unfortunately
they were out.,
Food was inconsistent.,inconsistent
"We had pulled pork, brisket and jalapeno sausage.",
"The brisket was wonderful, the pork was very well done and smokey but didn't really have any flavor and the sause is very watery.","wonderful, very watery"
"The jalapeno sausage was horrible, it looked like something they stuffed into a casing and boiled till it stopped screaming.",horrible
"The best part of the meal the corn bread, it served in a little caste iron skillet and is some of the best I have ever had.",
They have only been open for a week so I will give them the benefit of the doubt and try them again in a couple of months.,open for a week
There a lot of good things and some bad.,
 I am going to chalk most of the bad up to being new and still working out the bugs.,new

I sat at the bar and the service was good but you could tell the staff was still learning the ropes and didn't know the menu or have a good ordering system.",good
 There were several people behind a fairly small bar which caused some chaos.,fairly small
 The beer selection seemed to be good but they were out of several beers.,"good, out of several beers"

Shout out to Manager Eric for being so present and gracious!,so present and gracious
My husband and I will definitely be back.,

This place is all kind of awful from its concept to its execution.,
Awful on all levels.,Awful on all levels .
For starters they are specific on their offerings and nothing can be substituted.,specific on their offerings
 The menu had too many  instructions...,too many
all which made ordering a hassle only to raise cost.,
We ordered an appetizer which we didn't like...we couldn't figure out if it was a Mexican or bbq restaurant!,Mexican or bbq
We decided not to order meals and the waitress looked at us like we were idiots.,
It then took us over 20 minutes to find her to get our check so we can get out of there!!!,
We tried the manager who was clueless and was standing there talking to other employees.,clueless
"Once he tried to actually hunt her down, it  took another 10 minutes.",

Do not waste your time or money.,

 It would be great if there was some other type of BBQ sauce to try but there wasn't.,great
"No sides included with your meal, those are extra.",extra
 We never got the fries that were ordered either.,
 The pulled pork was also very plain and didn't have much flavor.,very plain

The sweet potato mash with marshmallows was extremely delicious along with the 1/2 chicken.,extremely delicious along with the 1/2 chicken

Let me also say, that I have had the pleasure of talking to the head chef, and after speaking to him, I am even more convinced that he is always on the hunt for the best taste, sourcing the best ingredients, and serving the environment the best way possible.","even more convinced, possible"
"

One example...the fries.",
" Where most restaurants would probably just cut the fat off the meat, he uses the fat to cook the fries (yes, not vegan friendly, but this is a bbq joint...sorry vegan friends!), he wastes as little as possible.","not vegan, friendly, sorry vegan, possible"

Also, he is adamant about ingredient quality...and it shows!",adamant about ingredient quality

"its one of the top spots for BBQ in the greater cleveland area (yes, maybe better than mabels).",
 Enjoy some yummy BBQ!,
I REALLY wanted this place to be good.,good
The poor reviews kept me away for a long time but  I ventured in today for a late lunch around 3 PM and sat by myself at the bar.,
I managed to get a 9$ Prosperity Wheat (yeah 9 bucks) pretty quickly but then went unattended for way too long while at least 10 staff members milled around.,

When I finally got service I ordered the Momma bear combo or something like that.",
Pulled pork (dry and over salted) brisket (dry and flavorless) and ribs (fatty dry burned and tough and apparently boneless?!).,"dry, dry and flavorless, dry burned, tough, apparently boneless"
It came with a corn and bean salad and slaw which were pretty good and a roll from like Costco.,pretty good
If you want a piece of cornbread that's another $5.,
I didn't bother complaining  - I'm sure what I got was what they intended to serve.,sure
To top it off!,
 Their cloth napkins shed lint everywhere!,
So my black shirt is now looking like I have a bad case of dandruff!,

Good grief.,
Really!?!!?,

I can't photo the food since it is already in their trash.,
"

I used to come in here when it was Fishers and the makeover is spectacular.",spectacular
Great use of the space now.,
I'm not optimistic that this crew can improve their offering (It really is THAT bad),THAT bad

 I won't be back until then.,
"Went there for lunch, beautiful interior and nice bar area.",
" Had the pulled pork 'el jefe' style, very tasty but they could have done a little better pulling some of the fat out.","very tasty, little better"

 We were disappointed!,disappointed
We were sceptical to try this place based on the mixed reviews.,sceptical to try this place based on the mixed reviews
And now after trying their food I too have mixed feelings about this place.,
"The atmosphere and decor is nice, two dinning areas and a nice outdoor patio.",nice
The one thing that is missing is the great aroma of smoke.,

Over all the meats were really underwhelming.,really underwhelming
Some sides were ok but nothing to write home about.,ok
"Now I am not a pit master and it could just be me, because the place was jammed around lunch time.",
So don't just trust the reviews try it for yourself.,

The pork had no bark.,
I'll repeat for emphasis: the pork had no bark!,

All on par with the quality a friend who just got into cooking.,par with the quality
"

We tried the Mac n Cheese and the corn bread.",
"The  former had too thin a sauce for the noodle type, and did not hold flavor.",too thin
"As a cheddar sauce, it probably could have used more (or any) roux in addition to some salt and mustard powder for flavor.",

Mexican undertones of flavor in the menu are common at BBQ joints these days, and maybe the tacos are the way to go here.",common at BBQ joints

"The service was excellent, I just hope the chef can put his ego aside, realize he is putting cheap on a plate, and feed his customers something more on par with the service.","excellent, cheap on a plate"
 I expected So much more from an overpriced bbq joint.,much more
Don't waste your time or money on this place.,
Over priced with mediocre food.,
I ordered a brisket and two beers for my dinner.,
"The brisket was dry, the brioche buns that came along were cold and the beer was $9 each!","dry, cold"
Food is amazing.,amazing
" If you love BBQ, this is the spot for you!!",
Eastsiders rejoice because we finally have great BBQ,
 Too bad,Too bad
Poor service.,
"I asked about the ""hot chick"" sandwich...",
"the server answered simply ""no"".",
Gave no explanation.,
The drink was very weak.,very weak
"They were out of several beers we ordered, including bud light.",
The server even crossed out the beer they did not have.....,
I have to say the food was good tho!,good tho
"Nachos app, pulled pork, mac n cheese, tacos; all really really good!",really really good
Would get takeout.,
It's a very nice place with a great wait staff and a cozy feel.,very nice
"But the problems are two-fold...first, the ""smoke flavor"" is completely missing and this is BAD when ""Smokin"" is the restaurant's first name.","two-fold, completely missing, BAD"
The meats have no smokey BBQ flavors whatsoever.,
Thank God for the extra sauces on the table.,
"

Second is the price...",
"I don't mind paying $22 for a full rack of ribs, but I was hoping for a big rack and/or large side portions.",
"But instead, you'd get a small scoop of slaw, a bun, and a few slices of onions with a medium-size rack.",
"After adding extra sides such as corn, sprouts, mac and cheese, our two-person dinner tab was close to $70.",close to $ 70
And that's drinking water only!,
It's a tossup whether I'd recommend that you come here because I would need a great reason to go back again.,
Great restaurant addition to the area.,
The menu is awesome and the food is just as great!,"awesome, as great"
"The pulled pork, Mac & Cheese and cobbler are some of our favorites.",
Great selection of beers on tap.,
This is our new favorite local place!,
"The bad first,  it was freezing in the restaurant.",
Then they were out  of the first three draft beers we ordered  from the menu.,
The good was the food.,
 My 1/2 chicken El Hefe style was excellent.,excellent
"The others enjoyed their tacos, except every one would preferred soft tortillas
Instead of greasy hard ones.",
Our waitress was road house perfect!,road house perfect
We will return but not a third time if is still so sub zero.,so sub zero
Food was great!,great
 Manager needs to get a handle on the wait staff.,
 I sat at the bar for a hour and watched three waitresses literally do nothing but complain to each other while doing no work.,
 You have one waitress bringing down the rest of the crew with the complaining.,

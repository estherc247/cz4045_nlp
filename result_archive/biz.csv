Disappointed in my Waffle.,After my third cup of coffee my waffle arrived.,It was obviously sitting under some sort of warmer while they made my wife's food.,I waited so long for my waffle I didn't have time to send it back.,I ate less than half and didn't want to eat any more cold waffle.,The waitress finally came by and asked if I wanted a box.,I told her no because the waffle was cold out of gate.,She didn't offer a resolution.,She actually said if she had made it it would have been perfect!,The place wasn't overly busy.,Plenty of tables.,Not sure why my food was cold.,Will not be going back.
y hubby really wanted to try the waffles so one blustery and gray Pittsburgh Saturday we decided to go and try.
"I have wanted to try WI for a while now and just didn't get there so now that they are so close, makes it very easy."
I checked the no wait app and there was no wait.
Onward we went.
There was a line but there was a huge party waiting to be seated.
It took a few minutes
but it was not bad and once we got to the host stand we were immediately seated.
"I have to say, unfortunately our waitress was not good."
She walked back and fourth a few times before bringing our coffee.
Making excuses.
Then she brought the wrong meal for my husband blaming the kitchen.
Never asked my hubby if he needed a water refill.
Then she brought the check and did not even ask if dessert was in our future.
"Thankfully the food was great (the only reason this gets a 4and not a 5, our waitress)."
"The waffles light and fluffy and the toppings we got were wow, just wow!"
And there are so many choices.
I chose the chicken and waffles.
I didn't even need syrup on it.
"The waffle with its pecans, light and fluffy."
"The fried chicken tenders on top were sweet, tender, and a little crispy."
"The hubby chose the sausage gravy and waffles, double portion which didn't look like a double but who are we."
But the sausage gravy was seasoned wonderfully with nice big  chunks of sausage.
"Overall, the food is delicious."
Our waitress was not good.
But I would and we will certainly go back.
I've love Waffles INC a long time--since their New Brighton location and am SO excited for them to have a move convenient for me location.
" I love the Funky Monkey Waffle and usually order it as it is wonderful but the first time we came to wexford, I decided to try something new and went with the Chicken and Waffles."
" It was wonderful, a ton of food for the money (four full chicken tenders and a huge waffle) and was so delicious."
 My dad stole one of my chicken tenders because I couldn't finish.
 We were a party of 5 and everything went well.
" My Dad had the sausage gravy waffle, my husband had the eggs benedict waffle and my mom designed her own."
" Everyone loved their food especially my 4 year old who ate every bite of his eggs and bacon and deemed this his new favorite restaurant so clearly, we will be back :)"
"On a Monday morning at 9:30, one would expect that the service would be fast and friendly;"
"However, this is not what my experience was."
The waitress was extremely slow and ignored my table a few times.
"It was very busy, but the waitress made my boyfriend and me feel like a burden."
"Sitting next to the door, I watched as people piled in without being greeted or seated for more than 15 minutes."
I would like to add that there were multiple tables available.
"

"
I ordered the Berry waffles and my boyfriend ordered Chicken and Waffles.
The visual aspect of the food was wonderful (check pictures below).
"The taste, was disappointing though."
The fruit was not fresh and the strawberry syrup overpowered the whole waffle.
"My boyfriend liked the chicken and waffles, but then later sat weird with him."
I could tell the kitchen was in a rush when preparing the food too.
"

"
"Overall, I am disappointed with my experience."
"However, I am going to attribute the poor service and taste with the restaurant being under staffed."
I will try to go back one more time before I make my final judgement.
"Hopefully, the staff will be plentiful with smiles on their faces- even during a rush."
What a welcome addition to Wexford!
Literally located in the plaza in front of North Allegheny High School and open at 8am for Breakfast/Brunch.
"When we searched for Brunch places to take our visiting out of town daughter last night & discovered this now existed, all 3 of us said, 'Done!'"
"We've been to the Southside location before & this one pretty much replicated the great food in a slightly larger space with a bit more elbow room, so it's a win."
"

"
"My husband and daughter both got The Chunky Monkey Waffles with bananas, peanut butter and chocolate."
There were loads of happy sounds from both of them across the table.
"I ordered The Souther' Waffles with chorizo, jalape√±os, cheddar cheese, salsa and cilantro."
Absolutely delicious with a nice kick of heat.
My husband finished my last waffle section on my plate & also raved.
Adding their Bourbon Maple Syrup to both our dishes was fabulous.
"

"
Portions are large and quite filling and there's always a special waffle each month that your server will describe.
"Our service was great, coffee cups were always filled with piping hot coffee and we'll definitely be back!"
Good food but service is very slow.
Need more staff.
Cooks shouldn't be serving the food too... has great potential but not with current situation.
We went for the first time on Fathers Day and it was predictably busy.
Happy we used NoWait app and got seated in about 5 mins.
The server greeted us promptly and courteously and took our orders quickly.
The wait for the food was a bit long but again because it was Father's Day they were at max capacity but the entire staff was hustling.
The food was really very good !
"I had the county mile, waffles, chicken, sausage gravy, and eggs over easy on top."
Delicious!
I would go back again and recommend to friends and family
My eggs Benedict was cold.
Manager came by and replaced my meal and did not charge me.
Second time around was great!
Food took an hour to come out of the kitchen.
It was sitting there for a good 10 minutes.
We finally went up to the kitchen and asked for our food and showed out anger; afterwards the manager came up to us and offered to take care of our bill!
"Service was slow and staffing does need practice, but manager sure knows what he is doing!"
I do recommend this place for big parties or people with big appetites.
I rate this at 3 stars because of the little dilemma with the food but overall this place was delicious!
The waffles were great....
they were light and flavorful.
 Wait staff was cheerful and actually looked like they enjoyed being there....
saturday noon the place was full
This place has great food!
They have so many options which  I love and we got a whole bottle of syrup so we never ran out which I loved and they have the best waffles here they are so good!
The service was really good and you can also customize your own omelette.
"The food is delicious, and they even had a vegan waffle option which is rare."
I definitely recommend this place!
Poor first impression: Staff doesn't seem interested in keeps by clientele happy.
 It likely ruined my whole experience.
"
"
The hostess was slow to seat us despite there being many empty tables.
 I watched one potential customer turn around out the door when he saw us and one other person waiting to be seated.
 Our waitress showed up quickly but I was 'advised' there were many people ahead of me for a latte (really- one machine?) and it might arrive after our food.
  
That said my daughter's oj showed up well after the people seated next to and after us got their drinks.
 I declined a drink (what ever happened to cranberry juice?) and looked over the food menu.
 I can't say the options were all that impressive-  fats and sugars smothering bread for most of it.
 Diabetes waiting to happen for about $10-11 a plate.
  
When I finally got to order I asked for a cup of coffee with a shot of peppermint-  ok European cup sizes with mediocre coffee overwhelmed by huge shot of peppermint and no offer of creamer.
 I finally had to ask for creamer.
"

"
Then the food arrived and it was tasty.
 A bit more oil was left on my plate than I'd like but overall the food was good.
 Certainly better than the service but not necessarily enough to sending be rushing back.
"For the price, I'd rather head to First Watch."
 The food and service is a lot better.
Every time I go here the food is phenomenal.
I have never had a dish that disappointed me.
From savory to sweet they have it all!
I always use the Nowait app and never have a problem getting seated.
I always give this place a chance in hopes to get a better service..
but it's always a disappointment.
Their food is usually really good.
"Except today, we got a side of fruit salad and all the grapes were moldy and rotten."
We mentioned it to our sever and she just said she will let them know.
"Manager didn't even come out to apologize, our server didn't even apologize and gave zero care."
She was very short with us and very miserable.
I was being polite the whole time
but she just gave us a terrible service.
"Also, they told us they took out the grapes out of the fruit salad.."
"I said ""well, the grapes were covered in mold and you're going to just take the grapes out and serve rest of the fruit?"""
And she ignored me and left.
Someone is going to get sick...
Will not be going back to waffles inc.
Another great experience at WI.
"I love the fact you can check in with the No Wait app, limits the amount of time you have to wait for a table."
"Tried 2 new waffles, the December monthly special Fig waffle and the Country Benedict."
Loved them both.
Just an fyi the military discount here is 10% every day and 40% when in uniform!
The food here is just decent.
" I got the ""Benny"", which is eggs benedict on a waffle."
 The waffle was a bit softer than I like but the toppings were ok.
 
"I ordered homes fries and bacon on the side, those were actually the best part of the meal for me."
" On the plus side, service was very good and they accommodated our every need."
This is a five star breakfast place.
 
The gluten free waffles are excellent and the house made syrup.
 Highly recommend the potatoes.
 Definitely coming back.
"Great food, nice service, simple menu."
" My only complaint was that the side order of eggs was small, but everything else was big."
  
Definitely making this a common stop for breakfast.
This was my second time at Waffles INCaffeinated
and i was highly disappointed this time considering my first experience here was great.
"I came with my friend and her husband, and we had asked for a larger end table, since my friend and I are immunosuppressed."
"While the hostess (brown/red hair and freckles) couldn't have guessed that, the eye rolling and annoyed attitude should not have been present."
"Once we were seated, it took forever for our waitress to appear to take our drink order, at least 20 minutes."
"While we were eating, we could see and hear our initial hostess and another waitress badmouthing one of their customers and laughing about it."
"The food was great, but the waffles have significantly reduced in size, and the lack of service  (my friend's husband never did get his water) made me realize that this place is not worth visiting again."
Maybe another location.
"Waffles were mushy,,coffee was cold ,ordered blueberry topping the waffles came out with a drip of sauce over it.asked for more sauce charged me extra for it.my grandkids had French toast ,came out with no syrup.the total meal was $32.00 extremely overpriced."
Will not return.
Waiter was nice though.
I had no idea a Waffles INCaffeinated was coming to the Wexford area.
I've never been to one before
but I have heard of it.
"I was on the NoWait app the other day going somewhere else for breakfast and Waffles INC popped up (Yes, they are on NoWait!)."
I didn't go that day but told myself to try it soon.
"

I tried it today and I was pleasantly surprised."
It's located in the plaza right in front of North Allegheny Senior High School.
"If you drive too fast, you might miss it."
The sign outside is a little small.
The environment itself is pretty small too but quaint enough to be a nice-sized diner.
It wasn't too busy so we sat down right away.
"

"
"They have  a large menu filled with unique breakfast items like chicken and waffles, Eggs Benedict called ""Benny"" with a waffle substituted for the english muffin and topped with crab, and the ""Breakfast Magic,"" which is what I got."
"It's a waffle with bacon, cheddar cheese, and green onions cooked into the waffle topped with more bacon and cheese as well as a sunny-side-up egg."
"You can even create your own waffles, omelettes, and crepes with a large array of fillings and toppings."
"Also, the portion sizes are pretty large."
"

I'm a big coffee person so great coffee is key."
They have their own brew and I approve of it.
You can even pay fifty cents extra to include a shot of flavoring such as gingerbread.
You are given a small cup full of the syrup so you can accordingly add it to your coffee.
The coffee cups are a little small for my preference but the coffee itself is great.
"

"
"If you're looking to try something different for brunch other than your typical eggs and bacon, try this place!"
"First impressions are everything....


"
The establishment is cold feeling.
Cool blue walls might be fine in summer but not fall and winter.
"Noise, hard floors, loud music and bright spot lights on customers equal a non inviting environment 

Harsh kitchen smells, tiny coffee cups ."
"They aren't insulated either, our coffee was never hot ."
"

I know too much about the hospitality industry"
"and I spot flaws 

"
"The chairs were very uncomfortable 

"
The menu is different than many.
3 eggs instead of 2 .
The continental breakfast doesn't have an add waffle option.
"The oj was watered down, not fresh
"
"They brush your waffle with butter, I'd rather do it myself 

"
"The food is presented nicely, very nicely."
"

.?"
Why is the vanilla maple syrup clear?
"

Why on."
"Earth is the maple syrup, all3 of them so watery?"
To cut costs?
This was my favorite place for breakfast.
"However today, I ordered the benny."
It was ice cold.
"I asked for my bacon crispy, but it was also cold and limp."
"The potatoes were good, but cold."
 My friend told the waitress she doesn't like oniond but the dish she suggested was filled with them.
And cold.
Our dishes shoulda been warm.
 I have had better meals for less at dennys
I met a friend for a mid-monday lunch.
 Breakfast was the food of choice since it was his birthday!
 I have never been a big waffles person.
 (No to pancakes too)  But - being that I was at a waffle place - I felt like it was inevitable that I get waffles.
"

IF i am going to eat waffles - I like them with some crunch."
 My megaberry waffles - while beautiful was relatively soggy.
" I know it had some reduction on it - that helped with the ""soggieness""  but the outside could have still had a bit of crunch - right?"
 
Maybe that's just my preference.
"

While I didn't finish my waffles - I did finish the scrumptious berries!"
 My friend got the Chicken and waffles and devoured it.
"

"
They were not busy - granted it was a Monday.
 I can see it being packed on the weekendds.
 The service was great.
  
I would definitely go back - but go for their non-waffle selection next time ;)
I ate here with my wife for Sunday brunch.
We ended up going to north park in the morning and watched the wait time decrease on the yelp app from 45 minutes down to 0.
That is a VERY useful feature!!!
We were seated quickly and the inside is a little small and fairly packed in with tables.
"

I'm not a huge sweet person for breakfast, but I do love chocolate chips in my pancakes and the funky monkey waffle sounded amazing!"
I ended up going with the chicken and waffles instead since this isn't too popular a dish in the Pittsburgh area.
My wife and I shared a side of home fries as well.
The waffle was huge and tasty; a great combination of sweet and savory together.
 There were 4 large chicken strips on the waffle as well as scallions.
I liked the vanilla syrup better than the maple and the home fries were good as well.
My wife had half the berry waffle which looked great for a sweet tooth like hers.
"

I liked my experience here."
Prices are a little higher than what I typically would like to spend but the food quality is definitely there with some unique dishes.
The unique part makes this a worthwhile stop if you are a fan of waffles!
I had the Megaberry... incredible!
" Waffle was light and fluffy, berries delicious topped with whipped topping."
Busy but service was friendly and attentive.
We'll be back!
"Great food and excellent service, kept the coffee coming!!"
I can't wait to try the many other options that are available.
I don't know what brand of coffee they serve
but I seriously love it.
"I checked in with the NoWait app, which has recently partnered with Yelp, but when we got there, the hostess reported that it hadn't registered me as checked in."
"Frustrating, but he sat us within 8-10 minutes of coming here, and was very friendly and accommodating about it."
We ordered the caprese crab omelette and toast as well as a cinnamon waffle with whipped cream.
"Both were decently satisfying, and the maple syrup felt delightfully light in comparison to most store bought syrups."
"However, the portion size of the omelette was quite small, and we thought it would be larger since my father and I were sharing it."
"Overall, welcoming place, a cool little waffle joint."
I'll have to come back to review it again!
Absolutely delicious breakfast.
"Ingredients are fresh, dishes are creative."
This place brought me back to breakfast.
My 6 year old loves it too.
From the Eggs to the bacon to the waffles and chicken!
We will be back.
It'll be hard for me to go anywhere else for breakfast.
If you are in the mood for a good waffle then by all means try this place.
"However, the ventilation, or lack off, would ruin even the best food."
The place has an over-powering smell of fried food.
The smell is so strong that you are reminded of your meal throughout the day; the smell becomes immersed in hair and clothing.
The server was very pleasant and prompt.
"The place is known for waffles, which I suggest you stick to."
The $12 omelet was just okay and somewhat lackluster.
This is one of my favorite places to go for breakfast.
Our go to waffles are the chicken and waffles and eggs benny.
Delicious creative menu that you aren't likely to make at home with amazing specialty syrups (we get every one for different bites)!
"The food is excellent, but the service puts Waffles INCaffeinated far above any other restaurant in the area."
Quick service and everyone is so friendly that we feel welcome the moment we walked in the door.
Highly recommend
My wife and I came here for the first time this morning.
She had the BC Breakfast while I ordered Crepes with cream cheese and blueberries.
It took nearly 45 minutes before we were served the breakfast.
"(To be fair, the restaurant had a large number of patrons.)"
My wife found her breakfast quite satisfying.
"I wish I could say the same about my crepes which were small and leathery, the toughest crepes I have ever had."
"The blueberries were tasteless, the creme cheese sparse."
The presentation on a large square plate made the crepes look even smaller.
"The coffee cups were also small, certainly the smallest I have ever used in a breakfast restaurant."
"My wife found the over-easy eggs satisfying, and considered the home-fried potatoes among the best-tasting of any she's had in a restaurant."
"Because the restaurant was crowded, the noise level made conversation difficult."
"Food was amazing, but the ticket time was terrible."
"We order and 20 minutes later the waitress came to apologize and said ""our ticket times are slow today"" it took 50 minutes from the time we ordered until served."
"The waitress was great, food was amazing, but kitchen was terrible in speed."
Wow this place is bad!
My dad ordered a waffle with fried egg on top.
Seems pretty simple.
Instead he gets an omelette with fried egg on top (wtf).
The server didn't apologize once.
Everybody at the table ordered toast and they didn't pre-butter it.
"No problem, so we asked for butter."
Server brings 2 cups of melted butter (wtf).
I guess you pour the butter on the toast?
Or dip it?
Either way the food was a glorified Denny's.
I almost never give bad reviews
but this was just horrible.
Stay far away
I love this place!
 The portions are generous and the food is amazing.
" The chicken and waffles may be my favorite, but everything I've had has been very good."
" I don't normally like 'breakfast potatoes', but they take it to a whole new level and I love them!"
" For the latte drinkers, their signature latte is amazing, hot or cold!"
What a unique place for breakfast!!!
"While just slightly over priced, the menu gives you a wide variety of meals to choose from!!"
 I had the chicken and waffles which was fabulous and the vanilla bean syrup they offer is spot on!  
While the waitress worked as fast as she could - I do feel that a busy breakfast hour should have more than 2 waitresses working!
 The place lacked in decor that was welcoming and would tie in the unique food with the over all experience of the place!
This location is located in a small strip mall area in Wexford where the parking lot could stand to be slightly larger.
 
Most concerning would be the entrance and exit to the parking lot - if you're making a left hand turn from the parking lot you may be waiting for awhile on a busy highway at a busy travel hour.
 I rated a 4 because my boyfriend and I enjoyed the food so much!
Really poor service.
"It took way to long to get our drinks, foods, and checks and it wasn't even crowded."
The food was greasy and clearly not well made.
"

"
"Honestly, it gets worst."
"
"
"We were seated in a booth by the kitchen, and it smelled disgusting."
"On top of that, the booth was too high off of the ground and I was wearing a cashmere sweater and I had to lean forward so much that my back ached, and combined with the incredibly long wait, my elbows started to burn because the cashmere was creating a rash from learning over so much."
"

"
Also my legs began to ache because they were disproportional to the ground.
"

I feel like crying."
"In a half empty restaurant, we were told that even though we could be seated, it would probably be at least 30 minutes before we would be served because they only have 6 waffle makers."
"How does a WAFFLE restaurant only have the capacity to make 6 waffles at a time, when that's essentially the only thing they serve?"
" That might get you through on a Tuesday, but Saturday morning during brunch time you're basically turning away customers who will never come back given the plethora of options."
What to do on Super Bowl Sunday when the Steelers aren't in it?
Head to Waffles INCaffeinated for brunch.
"

This location is in a small strip mall - that it is literally in front of North Allegheny High School."
"There's a small parking lot, but we able to grab a spot."
" 

We checked the No Wait to see if there was a wait - but there wasn't so we were able to get seated right away."
We arrived around 1:45pm and they are open until 3pm - so it wasn't too busy and nice and quiet.
"

"
"I ordered the Mega Berry waffle, my mom ordered the Breakfast Magic, my Dad order a custom waffle with apples and pecans, and we split an order of the home fries."
My mom and I split our waffles down the middle.
"However, I enjoyed my Mega Berry waffle more."
"They also forget to add the whipped cream, but our waitress brought us a side of it."
"

"
They have a loyalty program - so with our visits we were able to get a waffle free or $8.00 taken off the bill.
Definitely a great loyalty program.
"

I'll be back again soon."
"After being open for a month, obviously still a lot to be improved."
it took an hour to get food!
"The cappuccino was mostly milk, not even drinkable, blueberries used in waffle were likely canned."
"""House made syrup"" was just sugar water."
"Eggs and tomatoes were tasty, but not worth the hassles."
" They gave us coupons for free meals at the end because it was such a disaster, but we won't go back."
Also be aware that there is no diaper changing station.
"Even though it was a small place and busy, we didn't have to wait very long (thanks to the No Wait ap)."
The coffee was great and they had a busgirl come by and fill people's cups whenever they were near empty.
Which was key because the cups were really small.
"

I got the eggs benny which comes on half a waffle with ham and crab meat."
"I asked for the waffle to be crispy, but i felt like it still could have been cooked a little more ""burnt."
""" It was still good, though."
And even though it was small it was still filling.
"

"
"My wife got the BC breakfast, with egg whites, a double order of fruit, blueberry toast, and a salad."
"Her egg whites were a little runny in the middle, but she didn't have the opportunity to send them back because our waitress never came by to ask how everything was."
"Also, I don't think the double fruit was really two orders."
Maybe 1.5 at most.
"

"
"We may go back, but wouldn't make a special trip to do so."
This is my first time here.
"

"
"It's small, but the use of the space is well thought out."
 The staff hustles and quickly preps the tables.
"

"
"The menu is made up of waffles, omelets and eggs."
"They like to put green onions on EVERYTHING, so be forewarned."
"

I will come back, try something different and review again."
But I will be back.
Decided to try a new place today .
This establishment is run very poorly .
From the moment I stepped into the restaurant until I left I was very unhappy .
The greeting at the door was very unfriendly .
The waitress took awhile to get our drink orders and seemed bothered to take care of us .
Once the food came it was ok
but the atmosphere just made me want to hurry up and get out of here .
This is not a place I would put on my favorite list too pricey for the less than acceptable service .
I won't return not worth the aggravation .
The waffles are yummy and the service is good.
Not very crowded during the week.
Try the mega berry waffle!

"Great concept, good coffee and always attentive, friendly service."
Interesting selection of menu choices with sweet and savory selections.
I would like it a lot more with healthy meat options and meat sides.
This place is delicious!
"I love that they have a gluten free waffle, because gluten free breakfast is hard to find at restaurants."
The only disappointing thing is how expensive it is.
Every topping and side costs extra.
The staff is extremely friendly and there is never a wait!
Recommended!
Waffles Incaffinated sounded like a great place to stop in for brunch.
Located in a small strip mall with a small parking lot we were thrilled to find out there was no wait for a table for two.
"I tried the coffee, but had to change it for a water."
"I personally didn't like it, too strong for me."
I am very picky when it comes to coffee.
We went with a Breakfast Magic and a Funky Monkey waffle.
We were both really happy with them.
Terrific waffles topped with pretty much any and everything under the sun.
Crisp edges and tender insides that are excellent vehicles for top notch additions.
"The Fubky Monkey had a large dollop of house made peanut butter, bananas, chocolate syrup and a sprinkling of icing sugar."
"The Breakfast Magic waffle had crispy bacon, shredded cheddar cheese, green onions and 2 medium fried eggs on top."
Should have drizzled some maple syrup on top but didn't think of it until it was too late.
We thought the idea of a waffle place was great and we will definitely be back.
10% military discount.
We were also given a pinch card for future visits.
When we saw WI was coming to Wexford we were excited for it to open and try it.
"Unfortunately, it did not meet our expectations."
"

I echo what many others said in the previous reviews: sign is too small (easy to miss), smells gross when you first walk in, slow service, food takes way too long."
"

"
"However, I disagree on one primary thing."
My husband and I were not impressed with the food.
It's fair at best.
"I hate bad service (especially when you have to beg for drinks like we did), but there is no reason to go back when the food is average."
"

I ordered the Southern Breakfast (waffle stuffed (or should I say contains a tiny bit of) with chorizo (Mexican sausage, which I normally love, but it didn't taste like chorizo at all so just call it sausage) and an egg."
It was just ok because it only had a little bit of chorizo and the waffle just was ok.
"

"
My husband had the chicken and waffles.
"Everyone raved about it (and he normally loves it), but did not agree."
He thought the chicken was bland (and he likes plain food) and the waffle was just ok.
"

"
The only good thing about this experience was the home fries.
"They were very good (a little too salty), but not enough to bring us back."
"

We were happy to have another breakfast spot in Wexford."
Too bad this place falls way short.
Hope they get their act together.
"Service was excellent, but crepes were terrible."
Friends got waffles (breakfast magic) that were pretty good but everything was pretty overpriced.
Coffee tasted good
"and it's nice to see a small business being busy, but I'd like to have better quality food that actually comes hot for the price!!"
Waffles INCaffeinated is a delightful little spot perfect for a late breakfast on a Saturday.
I don't understand for the life of me why people would be willing to wait over 30 minutes for a waffle...
that's why I waited a few months after opening before I decided to give this place a try.
"

My wife and I arrived around 9:30am and didn't have much of a wait, although it seemed to fill up quick after we got there."
The ambiance is simple.
Nothing really makes it stand out...just seems to feel like your everyday breakfast spot...not super inviting.
The menu is a bit intimidating with all of the options.
I decided to go with the Waffle of the month.
"It was a mocha waffle with white chocolate chips, strawberries and espresso infused whipped cream."
I also had a side of their home fries.
What I loved about this waffle was the flavor...
it's all about the flavors working together people!
I never get too enthused with places like this because the breakfasts seem so decadent
"and I'm afraid the meal will be a ""punch-you-in-the-mouth"" sweetness that will inevitably be cavity inducing."
"However, I was so impressed with the flavors in my meal rather than the sweetness."
I really enjoyed it.
The potatoes were nice too.
"

Coffee was good - check
service was good - check
food was good - check

All in all, this place is a winner."
The only thing I didn't like was that it was a little loud and my jacket smelled greasy for a couple days after my visit.
The food is super tasty!
I made my own waffle
+ it was cooked to perfection!
I also really liked the coffee.
The wait staff was friendly and even let us stay past closing to finish our coffee + order dessert without making us feel rushed or rude.
Definitely recommend stopping by if you're in the area!
On my day off from work I figured I would treat myself to some waffles for breakfast!
I have been wanting try waffles incaffeinated for a while now
and when I found out they were putting one in Wexford
I was so excited to try it out.
"

"
"For starters it's located in the plaza next to North Allegheny High School and the sign is a bit hard to see from the road, but it's there I promise."
I was seated right away and my waitress was extremely friendly and attentive.
"I ordered the mega berry waffle that comes with whipped cream (I told them to hold the whipped cream), powdered sugar, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and raspberry syrup."
The waffle itself is infused with more berries!
I also added the vanilla bean drizzle which added some additional sweetness.
"Their menu has some other options for those that might not be feeling waffles (omelette, French toast and crepes)."
Pricing is pretty fair for the size and amount of food you get!
"

"
Cons: One thing that I can't say I'm a fan of is leaving and smelling like grease.
Yuck!
"Also, the center of the waffle was a bit doughy, but I guess that's expected when you add a lot of fruity toppings."
"

Other than that I would give this place another go!"
Wanted to try this place for a while.
Nothing special.
"The menu is huge which I guess is a good thing, but it's a bit much."
You can get almost anything on a waffle.
I had bananas.
It was ok.
They have different syrups to try.
Our waitress was friendly and attentive.
Been there done that.
Don't think we'd be back any time soon unfortunately.
Love this breakfast place!
Their waffles are delish and servers are fast!
My fave breakfast spot in North Hills.
Very good food.
But sort of pricey.
First time here and had delightful service.
The gentleman that waited our table was very nice and quick.
Lovely experience!
"The food is wonderful but no matter if the place is empty or full, it should not take 45 mins to cook and serve breakfast fare."
" Either they send staff home earlier than they should while they can not handle the workload full staff, or they have managed to make waffles into a 45 min item."
 Either way I feel like they push slow to new levels and make me question my future patronage
Best breakfast in Wexford!
Sausage gravy will never be the same.
Bennys?
Killer!
Potatoes completely reimagined.
And even roast tomatoes on the side.
I was loving it all.
"To top it off, the coffee was robust and flavorful."
Try a latte or two...
In response to the owners response...
I deleted my original review of the E. Carson downtown location and moved it to the Wexford location which is where I dined.
"We ordered what we wanted, clearly stating a waffle with fried egg on top."
"Never once mentioned ""the carnivore""."
The server placed the order wrong.
You making more excuses for bad service verify's my original 1-star review.
I am clearly within Yelp's guidelines as well
Food was amazing.
"Server was very friendly, but was not very good."
"The coffee cups are very small, and she was pouring half cups of coffee."
The coffee also tasted like bad gas station coffee.
Surprised since breakfast places usually have great coffee.
Our food took a really long time and the people next to us waited an hour for food because the server forgot to put in the check.
We've all been there.
The checks got messed up and I ended up being charged for double what we owed.
The manager was very nice and did as much as he possible could to fix the situation.
"So, breakdown...."
"foods amazing, service is bad(this time), coffees gross, but the staff is very friendly."
We will be going back after they get more settled into this new location.
Probably the worst customer service experience I have ever had at a restaurant.
Service was extremely slow.
They were busy.
Food was mediocre at best.
I've had better Eggo waffles than what we had.
The waffles had absolutely no taste to them.
It was like eating soggy bread.
We got one refill of coffee while there for an hour.
We each got a half a cup and they were full of grounds.
"

I would have complained, but there is a story behind that."
One of the servers whacked my wife in the back of the head with a heavy serving plate.
It left a large welt on the back of her head and was very painful.
"When the ""manager"" finally made her way over to us to ""apologize"" once she was done talking to her friends, she left."
"Not that I was looking for anything, but she sent the server over later to tell us she was giving us 10% off our meal because of the trouble."
"

I was more insulted by that, than the accident."
What if this had been a senior citizen or a child.
Maybe you shouldn't seat people behind the serving pick up line where they are in danger.
"We only think you were a little bit hurt, so here is $3 off."
We will not return.
"

I did forget to mention that the manager brought us a fruit bowl about 30 minutes later."
"

I did speak with the owner, and he offered us a do-over."
"Over a week has passed, I guess he is not going to follow through on his promises, as the gift certificate he said he would send has not arrived."
This place is OK.
Went with a couple of friends.
Everything on the menu sounds delicious.
My issue is mostly with the speed of service.
"We waited 35 mins to be sat, which was to be expected and didn't bother us."
"However, once we were seated we were given drinks and then basically abandoned."
It was 30 minutes before we were able to order.
Then the longest part of the waiting...
40 minutes for our food (all waffles).
"Which even then, wouldn't have been so bad if we didn't have to watch as other parties who were seated after us get fed within 12 mins of placing their order."
"
I got the southern waffle and added avocado."
The batter they are using is great.
The waffle was light and spongy and tasted fresh.
The portion sizes are small.
"I don't know how every one else feels, but when I think of eating a waffle, I think of being full with yummy syrupy fluffy goodness for a good portion of the day."
"My check ended up being over $12 for just a waffle (not including tip) and I unfortunately, left the place still hungry."
"I really expected to love this place, but it just didn't happen.


"
Ps.
The owner might want to look into exhaust (installing or repairing) fans above the kitchen area...
our entire party left the place smelling like old grease.
Blechhhh.
My wife and I went to Waffles INC this morning for breakfast.
" I ordered eggs over easy, bacon, home fries and toast."
 The eggs arrived slimy and floating in a pool of water (literally).
 The bacon was flavorless.
" The ""house specialty"" home fries were dry and had no seasoning."
"

"
This place is noisy and chaotic.
" If you go, check in with their app or you will sit there and watch many customers get seated before you."
"

This place is highly over rated and over priced and is proof of the dearth of good brunch venues in the North Hills."
I went to Waffles INCaffeinated yesterday (Sunday) for brunch.
"My party included four adults, and two toddlers (in high chairs)."
" We used the ""no wait"" app to put our name in around 10:25am and received a table at about 11:10am."
"The app makes the whole process easier, however if you show up early, or don't use it at all, there is NO WHERE to wait inside."
" Plan to wait in your car, or outside."
  
We waited several minutes for our drink order to be placed and about 15 more minutes to place our food order.
We finally received our food around 12:30pm.
 That was entirely too long to wait.
" When our order finally arrived, everything was correct, but we were all so hungry and cranky that no one cared what the food tasted like by that point."
" Someone needs to go in and evaluate the whole operation, otherwise they won't be around long."
"Also, small minor side note - the ""kids menu"" is not served in a kid friendly way."
They don't have kids cups or plates.
 Imagine toddlers trying to use ceramic dishes and coffee cups for their beverage.
Delicious!
"We got the chicken and waffles, the sausage and gravy, and the veggie omelet."
Everything was so delicious!
"They have 3 different syrups: vanilla bean, bourbon barrel, and regular."
They are all to die for!
I've been wanting to try this place for a while as I love breakfast food!
"This is a smaller restaurant and we went on a weekday, so it was not very crowded."
The waitress was friendly.
"I ordered the make your own waffle with mix-ins of pecans and raspberries, with toppings of cheesecake cream and raspberry sauce."
I also ordered a side of home fries.
"The waffle was crisp and light, and with the compliment of toppings and mix-ins, was not overly sweet."
"They have a trio of syrups to choose from... maple, bourbon and vanilla bean."
The vanilla bean and maple were tasty; but my husband and I found the bourbon to taste almost medicinal.
"The home fries were the star of the meal; a variety of potatoes with peppers and onion, perfectly crisp without being oily."
They also were very well seasoned... any more and they would have been too salty.
The food was delicious.
So many different options on the menu it's hard to decide what to get.
I do recommend looking on Nowait to get yourself in line before you head there
I met a friend at Waffles INCaffeinated for a mid-morning breakfast on a Monday.
It is located in a small strip in Wexford and is deceivingly larger inside compared to how it looks from the exterior.
"When I arrived, there was plenty of parking and the dining area was not very full."
My friend and I were promptly seated and offered beverages.
Our waitress was friendly and was patient with us as we took our time deciding on what to order.
"The menu is composed of a variety of unique waffle combinations (DUH), omelettes, breakfast sandwiches, crepes, french toast, and a small selection of side dishes."
"After a long debate, I settled on the Funky Monkey, waffles topped with bananas, chocolate chips, powdered sugar, and a mini Hershey bar."
It was like dessert for breakfast with a banana thrown in the mix!
My friend ordered the Breakfast Magic which was an egg breakfast on top of a waffle!
How creative!
 The waffles were huge and thank goodness we had a lot to catch up on or they would have required us to stay longer than we anticipated just to finish our meals.
"

"
"Though the food was good and the portions fairly large, the prices were slightly high."
I ordered a cup of tea and that alone was $2.
"When returning, I will probably stick with ordering waffles since that is what they are in business for and I can get the other menu items somewhere else for a better price."
"Overall, this was a nice place with a unique twist on breakfast waffles that is worth a try!"
"We tried this restaurant for the first time this morning, and even though it is Father's Day my husband and I were seated immediately."
"He got the breakfast tacos after seeing them on the table next to us, and he loved them."
I got the breakfast magic and asked to have avocado added on top.
"Oh my, it was fantastic."
"Unfortunately, it was huge and I had no chance of finishing it successfully."
We will definitely be back.
Terrible......
Do not go!!!!
McDonalds is north just up the road on the same side.
I suggest you go there.
Where to begin.
"Here visiting a friend and they recommended this place and boy howdy, I am not disappointed."
Started off with their Signature Latte and Cappuccino.
It's quite possibly the best sweetest coffee I've ever had.
My husband almost went into convulsions because of how sweet it is.
But I loved it.
I had their sausage gravy waffle and my husband had their Souther waffle.
We both discreetly licked our plates when had no more food to eat.
"Staff was pleasant, no real atmosphere to speak of but who cares when the food is this good."
Glad my diet doesn't start until next week!
I'll put this on my list of never coming back to.
2nd time I tried it.
"
"
Poached eggs poached in oil?
Weird.
I've had poached eggs at over 60+ breakfast places and never have I seen this.
"
Crepes filled with marshmallow fluff (almost non-existent)!"
"
"
"The waiter had to comment on everything we ordered, coffee we drank, water we drank."
Here is a tip: just wait on people and don't comment on their every move.
We love Waffles INC!  
We frequented the original in New Brighton years ago and so pleased to see the shops grow all over the Pittsburgh area.
" They have great service, pleasant atmosphere and the food is outstanding!"
 Congrats on your recent opening in Wexford!
Stopped in the new Wexford location on a Saturday morning around 9:30am.
" It wasn't packed yet, but by 10:00 there was a line out the door."
" The food was absolutely delicious, but lukewarm."
" The coffee mugs are definitely too small (hello, there's a coffee mug in your logo!)"
and the waitress was too busy to stop for refills.
" We sat with empty cups for about 20 minutes, finally stopping her as she raced by and asked for the refill."
 
A simple carafe on the table would solve this problem.
"In the end, we only had two small cups of coffee."
Our food sat under the warmer for at least 10 minutes.
I watched them plate it and then watched it sit there.
"Finally my husband got up and approached the window, asking if we have to take our own food."
" It would behoove the owner to hire some kids from the high school to have them bus, pour coffee, and deliver food."
 
Clearly the waitresses are too busy to be on top of these kinds of things during peek times.
"We waited awhile for our check to be delivered, too."
"The waitresses all seemed to be very friendly, but they were overwhelmed."
"Our visit took 90 minutes, which is a long time to spend at breakfast."
Hiring some teenagers who can hustle could potentially cut a table's occupancy time in half.
A step above your typical breakfast place.
"Friendly staff, quick and attentive service, despite being continuously busy."
"So many choices on the menu, it's hard to decide."
"But when at a place with Waffles in the title, of course that's where I've got to go."
"I had the Funky Monkey - a chocolate, banana and peanut butter explosion."
"Pretty good, although waffle could have been a little crisper on the outside for my liking."
"Add a side of scrambled eggs (for protein, of course!) cooked perfectly, and a coffee cup our waitress never let get more than half empty."
"I'll be back for sure, next time to build my own omelette."
What a great breakfast spot!
 First time in
and they easily accommodated a party of 9.
 EVERYONE was happy with the meals...even the picky kids.
 Meals were fast...
ingredients were fresh.
 Everything was delicious and everyone cleaned their plates!!
"

I had the breakfast - 3 eggs, toast, bacon, fruit, and mushrooms."
 Love that their sides are different and loaded with fresh veggies.
 Bacon was divine.
 Thick and perfectly cooked.
 Bread was thick and tasty.
" 

I was lucky enough to try my nieces waffle with some bourbon maple syrup."
 Whoa!  I could do shots of that and need to go back to get waffles just to eat/drink copious amounts of that!
Good food.
 Decent prices.
Appropriate portions.
 Boring atmosphere.
 They did the best they could in a strip mall building.
  Clean and bright.
  
"It is a solid choice, but didn't get ""wowed"" by the experience."
I went crazy with my make my own crepe and had a chocolate chip and bacon crepe with caramel sauce!
Talk about delicious!!
They have great service and the coffee was superb.
We will definitely be back for our big breakfast fix again!
"Used the no wait app, which cut back on us standing around outside since the waiting area is VERY tiny."
"Small place, many different selections of waffles."
"I chose the French toast, and it was very good."
Everyone in our party enjoyed the food.
"Good service, we would come back again."
There was a bit of a wait but totally worth it!
The food was amazing and the service was awesome!!
Lauren is the best!
I totally recommend asking for her.
"She was funny, kind, and very attentive!"
Loved this place and will be back!
The food was just okay.
We ordered to go- the home fries were awful.
They are not your traditional home fries by any means and they are terrible.
 The waffle was decent.
The eggs Benedict was good.
A little expensive.
$14 for that and coffee is a little overpriced.
The place needs better ventilation.
I came out of there smelling like I've been in a grease pit!
Nice little breakfast spot.
"Friendly people, good service, very good waffles AND they have some vegan options which is super fun."
 It's a cool atmosphere and feels clean.
We have eaten there several times and will certainly be back!
Looking for a different breakfast option?
This place is for you!
"Being only the 4th review, I will give you the rundahn!"
"
"
Pros: food is excellent!
The breakfast magic that I had was savory and fresh!
My wife had the blueberry waffle and it was delicious.
Waitress Nikkie was friendly and informative.
This confirms the first three reviews on friendly service!!
"

"
"Now the cons (sorry, there are a couple .."
keeps it from a 5star affair)
"As the 1st review stated, the coffee mugs are too small."
"We asked our server a lot for ""more coffee""."
"
"
"A suggestion would be to either get larger mugs OR get coffee carafes and leave them on the table (a la Perkins)
Second comment (which was also stated by another reviewer) was the smell when walking in."
My guess is a little more exhaust ventilation.
"

Final Answer: great place to go!!!"
The best breakfast we have had in years!
I had the Benny Waffle.
Delicious egg Benedict with fresh crab.
Greatest home fries ever!
Made with multi colored mini potatoes and sweet potatoes.
Coffee was good.
My wife had the Funky Monkey and couldn't stop raving about it.
Daughter had what was the best sausage gravy I have ever tasted.
May get that myself on a return visit.
My 6 year old son thoroughly enjoy his waffles with chocolate sauce.
"Environment, and atmosphere was thoroughly enjoyable."
"Great place, great food, we'll be back."
"

Only downside, like some of the other reviews state, the smells of the kitchen tend to attach themselves to your clothes."
This place gets extra points for having food I can order for my kids which is not hamburgers and fries.
"We ordered the kids banana and strawberry crepe, and the chocolate chip waffles."
They were a big hit!
My wife and I shared at the BC breakfast with blueberry toast.
The waiter was very courteous and we were quite impressed overall.
This is probably the BEST place to get brunch.
The customer service is very friendly.
The atmosphere is awesome.
Very nice place to go on a date or just hang out with friend and family.
Highly recommend the eggs Benedict.
Al I can say about this place is: gorgeous!
I was able to get a kid sized portion and customize my waffle to my liking!
How do you know a place is good?
When you haven't even finished your first meal and you're already planning your next visit!
"This was my first visit ever to a Waffles INCaffeinated, and I got to enjoy it with a rather large party on a Saturday afternoon."
The manager was very helpful and accommodating!
"

"
"Now, for the food."
My faith in humanity and homefries has been restored!
"(It's so easy to screw up potato, and it takes talent to make them taste amazing.)"
"The epic homefries feature a mixture of a variety of potatoes - white, sweet, blue/purple, as well as green peppers and onions."
"Everything was extremely well seasoned (any more and it might be too salty), and the crispness of the potatoes was amazing."
It was like eating cubed french fries or slightly more solid tater tots.
"Seriously, five stars for these little starches!!!"
"

"
"Waffles, because well...they're all about the waffles."
"I was a bit overwhelmed by the sheer variety of toppings, and had a plan going into my meal."
"The in-restaurant menu had more pre-made options than what was online, and greatly helped my decision process."
"I opted for the Sacre-Bleu-berry (blueberry waffle, peach cream cheese in the middle, and more fresh blueberries on top.)"
"To mine, I added raspberries because all those fruits together sounded delicious, and oh yes it was!"
"The syrup options on the table were a vanilla bean syrup (simple syrup with vanilla bean highlights), and traditional syrup."
"I tried both syrups, and felt the vanilla bean was perfect with just a hint of sweetness."
"

"
"Also, the coffee was coffee."
"If it's available, try a little vanilla syrup in it with your meal!"
"

I look forward to going back and trying some of the savory options like the waffle with in-house made sausage gravy and some of the chorizo waffles."
"Good food, creative entrees and will alter the orders to fit your tastes, decent service, a little pricey."
Very good breakfasts.
The waffles are defiantly good.
Was kind of annoyed when I went that they were out of 2 beverages I asked for - and one was decaf coffee
We've stopped in a couple times.
Ridiculous portions with great flavor and good coffee.
The country benedict waffle is top notch.
Good coffee as well.
Highly recommended for a big breakfast in the North.
We finally had the opportunity to try this place out this past Sunday morning.
 I checked the website for opening time and it said 8 AM.
 We got there at 7:55 AM the parking lot was empty and there were no lights on inside at all.
 The time on the door said 8 AM so we waited but there was no sign of life.
 We were so disappointed and mad because we had just gotten off of the night shift and were so hungry!
 Won't go back there again since it is clear they do not know how to run a business.
The use of Nowait now Yelp is the best thing ever.
The service is second to none and they remember thier repeat customers well.
Good job guys.
"On first impression, the new location in Wexford was at most a one star."
Doubt I'll visit this place again or any of their other locations.
"

After being seated, it was 15 minutes before we were greeted."
We placed our drink and food orders and received the drinks a long 10 minutes later.
The waitress apologized and told us the restaurant could only make one latte at a time and there were several drink orders ahead of ours.
"As happy as I was to finally have a hot drink after freezing in the cold weather, I was instantly let down because the coffees were nearly cold."
"

"
"The food came shortly after and the waffles were soft, definitely pre-made and had been sitting under a warmer."
"On a better note, the food still tasted good but the background noise of the waitress continuously apologizing to other customers was a pure indicator that this place was a terrible mess...at least this particular Sunday afternoon."
"

Won't go back..."
Totin's down the street is a better choice.
Went into the restaurant and waited to be seated.
Had a seat for 2.
Lots of seating.
 Restaurant was clean.
Server came over quickly and was super pleasant.
 I ordered the Carnivora Omelet with a side order of bacon and rye toast with coffee.
My guest had the Megaberry with a side order of sausage.
Order arrived quickly.
The omelet with the egg on top was delicious.
"Filled with bacon, sausage, ham, cheddar cheese, chicken."
 My guest Megaberry Waffle was huge.
It had blueberries and raspberries on the inside and berries on top with whipped cream and a vanilla  bean sauce.
 My guest advised that the waffle was soft and the berries were delicious.
The sausage patties were large.
Met a friend for breakfast.
"Waited quite awhile for a server to come over, and there were only 4 people in the place."
My friend ordered the crepes and I ordered the eggs benedict waffles.
"
"
They have background music which is so loud we could hardly speak to each.
"
"
"Our food was brought by a different server and asked if we wanted more coffee, we both agreed, but once again waited for it."
"Our original server never came back to check on us, except to bring the bill."
"
"
The prices are quite high for the quality of the food.
"We decided we were glad we tried it, but would not be back."
"I wanted to like this place more, but it was solidly average."
 The menu was good with decent variety of savory and sweet waffle choices among other breakfast items.
" They had gluten free waffles, which was nice due to a family member having a gluten sensitivity, and I had the chicken and waffles."
" Like other reviews stated, it was decent, but for $40 for 2 adults and 2 kids (who split a breakfast), I wanted to be wow'd."
" 

I always want to start with the good, but I think I already mentioned all the good."
 Good menu with decent food.
 They did have some decent syrup choices outside maple.
 We tried the vanilla and bourbon syrup.
" This isn't vanilla flavored maple syrup, it is vanilla syrup that pours clear."
 The bourbon on the chicken and waffles was very good.
"

Now on to what could make it better, with some of problems not being able to be changed."
 I think the biggest problem was the noise.
" It is a no frills d√©cor restaurant with two walkways with tables on both sides, but the room just echoed terribly."
 I could barely hear anything my family was saying across the table.
"

Our server was ok, but it was just slow."
" We did go on a packed Saturday, so it is understandable, but I need a bigger coffee cup than the Dixie cup sized cup of coffee they gave me which was gone is 0.2 seconds."
 It would be nice if they had runners in addition to the servers.
" For a breakfast place, your coffee cup should never be empty."
" In addition, our food was not very hot due to the fact that I stared at it sitting in the window for several minutes."
 It really wasn't our waitresses fault since she was taking orders at the time.
" (of course, it was the people who had a million questions, seriously people, it is a waffle place with good descriptions on the menu)."
" By the time she took their order than got our food, it was not that hot."
 It would have been nice to have someone running food out and filling coffee cups.
"

Like I said, it was good and different for the north hills."
" We will probably try it again, but not go out of our way"
We waited until 8:20 and still no sign of life!!
" Soooo if lights in front are the last thing you turn on then ""whoops!"""
 You forgot to turn them on and unlock the doors!
 Smh

Happy Hour is 12-7pm Monday thru Friday - just wish we had one of these in Wadsworth.,
There's really no good wing places like this nearby.,
I got the smoked wings and requested drums only (no up-charge).,

I expected this and it didn't bother me at first but my 22 year old son (who frequents BW3's which is also loud) said he wouldn't go back because of it.,"22 year old, loud"
We ordered the spinach dip to start.,
Unfortunately--perhaps because it was so loud--the waitress heard chicken tenders.,so loud
A man came over with the chicken later and we had to send him away TWICE after we informed him we ordered the spinach dip.,
The waitress came back and asked if we wanted the chicken and we told her--again--we ordered the spinach dip.,
She said would fix it,
and she did.,
The dip came fairly quick after that.,fairly quick
"But, we barely took one bite before our entrees descended on us.",
This annoys me because an appetizer is not supposed to be served with the entree and there was no room for 5 large plates and 4 small ones on the pub-style table.,
"However, the dip was quite good.",quite good
We all agreed.,
My son ordered a chicken sandwich with fries.,

"

Getting out of there was fairly speedy.",fairly speedy
We all considered not tipping (or not tipping much) but I personally having worked for tips in the past couldn't bring myself to punish the waitress for the crappy work of the cooks or the fact that she couldn't hear a damn thing in there.,
"She should have accounted for this and refused to serve bad food or double checked what we wanted, though.",

I guess I would give the place another try if someone wanted to, but wouldn't suggest it.",

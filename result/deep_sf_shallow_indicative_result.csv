disappointed in my waffle .
so long for my waffle
cold out of gate
overly busy
light and fluffy
so excited for them to have a move convenient for me location
4 year old
fast and friendly
weird with him
disappointed with my experience
plentiful with smiles on their faces - even during a rush
absolutely delicious with a nice kick of heat .
a bit long
hustling
light and flavorful
interested in
slow to seat us despite there being many empty tables
really - one
peppermint - ok
better than the service but not necessarily enough
savory to sweet
moldy and rotten
very short with us and very miserable
back to waffles inc.
just decent
a bit softer than i like
highly disappointed this time considering my first experience here was great
extremely overpriced
nice - sized
sunny
a little small for my preference but the coffee itself is great
fine in summer
too much about the hospitality industry
different than many
"watered down , not fresh"
so watery
cold and limp
"good , but cold"
inevitable
relatively soggy
busy - granted
very useful
a little small and fairly packed in with tables
too popular
huge and tasty
sweet and savory
better than the maple
great for a sweet tooth
a little higher than what i typically would like to spend
friendly and attentive
decently satisfying
delightfully light
larger since my father
so strong
very pleasant and prompt
just okay and somewhat lackluster
benny
likely to make at home with amazing specialty syrups -lrb- we get every one for different bites -rrb-
quite satisfying
small and leathery
even smaller
home - fried
best - tasting
terrible in speed
"amazing , hot or cold"
really poor
even crowded
too high off of the ground
incredibly long
disproportional to the ground
able to grab a spot
so we were able to get seated right away
open until 3 pm
too busy and nice and quiet
mega
program - so
able to get a waffle free
open for a month
drinkable
aware that there is no diaper changing station
near empty
a little runny in the middle
very unfriendly
bothered to take care of us
less than acceptable
exciting and different
always attentive
a lot more with healthy meat options and meat sides
hard to find at restaurants
only disappointing
how expensive
thrilled to find out
too strong for me
really happy
medium fried
excited for it
easy to miss
way too long
fair at best
"very good -lrb- a little too salty -rrb- , but not enough to bring us back"
happy to have another breakfast spot in wexford
pretty overpriced
nice to see a small business being busy
hot for the price
perfect for a late breakfast on a saturday
willing to wait over 30 minutes for a waffle
a bit intimidating with all of the options
too enthused with places like this
so decadent
"afraid the meal will be a "" punch - you - in - the - mouth "" sweetness that will inevitably be cavity inducing"
so impressed with the flavors in my meal rather than the sweetness
good - check
greasy for a couple
rushed or rude
so excited to try it out
extremely friendly and attentive
pretty fair for the size and amount of food
a bit doughy
very nice and quick
empty or full
slow to new levels
robust and flavorful
possible could to fix the situation
mediocre at best
full of grounds
able to order
light and spongy
full with yummy syrupy fluffy goodness for a good portion of the day
still hungry
noisy and chaotic
over rated and over priced
no
entirely too long to wait
so hungry and cranky that no one cared what the food tasted like by that point
crisp and light
perfectly crisp without being oily
very well seasoned
any more
hard to decide what to get
deceivingly larger inside compared to how it looks from the exterior
patient with us
how creative
slightly high
how sweet
glad my diet does n't start until next week !
weird .
almost non-existent
"absolutely delicious , but lukewarm"
too busy to stop for refills
too busy to be on top of these kinds of things during peek times
quick and attentive
continuously busy
hard to decide
"pretty good , although"
happy with the meals
thick and tasty
lucky enough to try my nieces waffle with some bourbon maple syrup
clean and bright
a little expensive .
savory and fresh
friendly and informative
multi colored
thoroughly enjoyable
quite impressed
able to get a kid sized portion and customize my waffle to my liking
very helpful and accommodating
so easy
a variety of potatoes - white
extremely well seasoned
slightly more
a bit overwhelmed by the sheer variety of toppings
more fresh
perfect with just a hint of sweetness
so disappointed and mad because we had just gotten off of the night shift
clear they do not know how to run a business
happy as i was to finally have a hot drink
nearly cold
super pleasant
so loud we could hardly speak to each
quite high for the quality of the food
"glad we tried it , but would not be back"
solidly average
good with decent variety of savory and sweet waffle choices
able to be changed
just slow
dixie cup sized
very hot due to the fact
nice to have someone running food out and filling coffee cups
good and different

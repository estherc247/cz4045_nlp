unable to resolve my complaints with the technician,1
american sent out another company who diagnosed and replaced the pool pump all under warranty,1

more interested in talking to her coworkers than working,1
pleased with the ribs he ordered,1

very overpriced,1
worth 800 the average price,1
 just fine such as beef tips and rice,1
such as weird brown lettuce on the taco salad,1
overcooked meat,1
best selling,1
bacon burger lunch special,1
so special,1
enough to dampen my spirits,1
rubbery and flavorless,1

more of a salad dressing than a sauce,1
intense and flavorful,1
different from the south and from cincinnati,1
tasteless and bland,1
fairly certain all the flavor was tossed out with the water,1
fairly certain they just mashed potatoes and added coloring and some red pepper and called it potato salad,1
not too fancy,1
really friendly and helpful,1
tired of the burgers pizza and subs,1
sure you will enjoy it as much as i do every time,1
really tasty,1

a few smaller,1
4th or 5th,1
pretty overpriced,1
hot for the price,1
willing to give the place another shot but,1
very happy with the selection,1
a bit challenging,1
perfect for a late breakfast on a saturday,1
willing to wait over 30 minutes for a waffle,1
a bit intimidating with all of the options,1
too enthused with places like this,1
so decadent,1
afraid the meal will be a punch you in the mouth sweetness that will inevitably be cavity inducing,1
so impressed with the flavors in my meal rather than the sweetness,1
greasy for a couple,1
rushed or rude,1
about 3 salespeople available,1
positive they saw me standing around the bags too,1
far more helpful and friendly,1
super disappointed with the customer service,1

pretzel related,1
really arbitrary,1
rather sloppy and wet,1
eccentric unusual,1

glad we finally tried it,1
robust and flavorful,1
helpful without being smothering,1
cheesy looking,1
big and sloppy,1
tiny and clear,1
too oily at all,1
even though i ready,1

unforgettable one,1
definatley going back,1
not very tasteful,1

fun and loud,1
reasonable for the quality and quantity of food,1
easy and comfortable,1

modest clean cozy,1
nice enough to give me a coffee anyways,1
really grateful to have a local business that really takes care of us,1
as cheap as it once was,1
a little long around lunch time,1
noisy and chaotic,1
over rated,1
possibly extremely unnecessary,1
always refreshing,1
right at noon,1
ready in a flash,1
dirty and deeeeeelicious,1
too cool to even acknowledge us,1
barely melted,1
too intrusive,1
fantastic for a quick lunch,1
more than capable of expressing any unmet needs,1
vendor so much,1
so engaging,1
back here great,1
women s clothing classic,1
good for mexican food,1
typical for most places like this,1
dense salty doughy just barely underbaked,1
glad to see there is humor still in the work environment,1
speedy and thorough,1
bad for not leaving more of a tip,1
amazing with the fella working came out to see how we were doing and even offered to put the unfinished ice cream lrb that the kid did not eat rrb,1
vegetarian salmon like,1
worth checking out since i do not know any vegetarian sushi places that have imitated raw fish,1
high for small plate,1
all cold even,1
 cold and unhelpful,1
vegan cheese available,1
entirely too long to wait,1
so hungry and cranky that no one cared what the food tasted like by that point,1
slowly sloppily,1
deliberate on their part,1
worthwhile to go for the ayce options based on some quick math,1
all around fine,1
a little gross,1
perfectly sanitary,1
good crisp and chewy,1
average in cost,1
responsible for us having a spectacular time,1

quick service,1
delicious and hot right out of the kitchen,1
hard to get attention,1
la unica plaza,1
particularly concerned,1
better off with some lime aritas and taco bell,1
popular before a show,1
complete with a lackadaisical attitude,1
so hipster they do not even want you here,1
dry so i could not finish it,1
special at all,1
other than that an aok experience,1
real slow,1
too hot for me,1
giant and wonderful,1
never fun,1
lrb very generous rrb,1
so very happy,1
a tad loud,1
fairly quick to repair lrb the back left tire rrb after that,1
worth that wait,1
the little kids are allowed to run around like a mcdonalds play zone which makes adult time a bit noisy,1
hard to find a decent almond milk latte,1
guilty of being one of those people who love a sweet drink though i am trying to cut more sugar out of my life,1
too loud to have a meeting there,1
sure they would turn it down if there was not too many people there,1
surprised such a casual restaurant would not be accommodating to families,1
good if not great,1
100 sure,1
tough to walk by and not pick up some pretzels to take home,1
great as left overs days,1
so cold it seemed like it came straight out of the walk in,1
akin to a rocking chair,1
too close to the minibooths,1
loud enough for us to hear each other chew cos she is a loud chewer,1
messy but really good,1
more knowledgeable about what they are doing,1
fabulous as close as to my gmas home cooking as it gets,1
sure the customers would appreciate it,1
clean soft and rejuvenated,1
great as well,1
la unica as a taco tuesday,1
fun for guys working on cars,1
right past me standing 5 feet from him and parks at the far end of the lot,1
ok not as amazing,1
glad i tried this now because nothing here stacks up to it,1
really solid could tell it was fresh cut before fried,1
inspiring but ok,1

deceivingly larger,1
compelled to call managment,1
so incredibly warm and friendly,1
great for group events fast service 1 tacos on tuesdays unlimited nachos,1
no shorter,1
other than that the pretzel was everything i imagined it to be,1
salty and soft,1

so mesmerized,1
petty good,1
fresh and spicy,1
most spicy and chunky,1
hard and soft,1
overall ok,1
amazingly authentic,1
no cream for you plain,1
enticingly unique,1
similar to montreal with their bagels,1
helpful and rude,1
open to see the consistency,1
interested in buying,1
lazy and rude,1
incorrectly prepared,1
fresh delicious and inexpensive,1
wrong with the pretzel shop,1
unnecessarily long,1
decent enough if i needed some mexican food nearby,1
memorable as i can not even remember what i ordered,1
special except for the hair in the salsa bowl,1
guilty of judging a book by its cover,1
as adamant,1
afraid of broadening my horizons,1
little more sour,1
so rare around az,1
so glad i have a mexican restaurant to add to my list of happiness,1
so glad my group got connected with michelle,1

an avocado based,1
vegan japanese,1
similar to konjac lrb konnyaku rrb or jelly,1
vegetarian on these specific days,1
pretty big i am going to,1
consistently awful,1

so easy to work with just a few simple texts,1
so glad i stuck to my guns and did not pay some outrageous fee that the other companies charge,1

very overpriced for the quality of food you get,1
sure to tell them light salt,1
not dried out,1
good for kids,1
definitely worth a try to satisfy your vegan palate,1
incredibly tasty,1
too busy to stop for refills,1
too busy to be on top of these kinds of things during peek times,1
food bright,1
truly disgusting,1
worst terrible,1
necessary to have 5 teen girls in the window,1
super reliable,1
especially michelle,1
more than enough as an appetizer or a meal,1
thick smoky,1
perfect late night,1

very happy with her excellent service,1
dr sebagh deep,1
fancy about this place,1
completely vegan,1
too bland for my tastes,1
sure to stop here for lunch,1
unfamiliar with their menu,1
open to 1030,1
glad to support them,1
full of crumbs or sticky,1
good with any sausage for example mayo ranch or polynesian,1

more spicy,1
just wrong unauthentic,1
so sad and empty,1
even authentic,1
able to get a burger served in a lettuce leaf if i do not feel like a bun,1
shocked and appalled,1
mostly young,1
decent too,1
tasty without the house sauce,1
decent at best that visit,1
especially evangeline,1
happy once again to be a discount tire customer,1
so grateful he did,1
equal to the rebate i could have gotten,1
terrible about sending in for my rebates,1
sure they had the equipment needed for my old odyssey,1
just plain,1
alone with her kids,1
greasy at all,1
quite big and nice,1
a bit disappointed by the sandwich i ordered,1
home baked,1
good had a nice crust on top with nice cheesy flavor,1
dried out,1
worth another try and some,1
hungry after a 2 hr massage,1
really excited to try their vegan sushi,1

salty baked pretzel smell and suddenly you think going to auntie anne s,1
dead wrong,1
right on east carson street,1
perfectly happy being a stoop dweller and taking up someone else s front steps to eat one of these salty snacks,1

a potential eye sore,1
dimly lit with several dining options,1
attentive i would go back for the sole sake of having her again,1
4 5,1
very good spicy,1
dark and stormy,1
glad we found our new favorite taco spot,1
more blessed,1
able to show a friend visiting las vegas an amazing night out,1
desperate for sashimi,1
entirely successful,1
weary what ingredients were used to make the mock fish,1
decently good,1
due to seasoning and teriyaki sauce,1
able to answer any questions,1
pretty fantastic,1
sure i would consider a white cashmere sweater activewear,1
cute as all heck,1
tacky to try on something and possibly ruin the sweater with any cigar odor,1
utterly bored,1
unprofessional and the,1
a million ultra high,1
one nice,1
short lived because i was told not to take pictures while waiting for my cousin to scope out a handbag,1
overly snobby,1
seemingly silly,1
industry unforgivable,1
other awesome,1
black on the bottom of the meat,1
not mexican,1
very gross,1
good for two weeks,1
sure to try the back entrance for a hot baked pretzel,1
sheepish to order something,1
very generous with my two stars,1
bad writing this review since i have been a customer at this restaurant for many years now,1
cool ambiance american,1
quite excited to finally try it,1
very disapointed with the food,1
this helpful,1
bad but not worth,1

guilty for not spending more time with my dog,1
nice to get out of the heat and into some retail therapy,1
too cheesy,1
crispy enough,1
small and uncomfortable,1
highly unrecommended,1
out of biscuits,1
okay way to tell me when i order instead of telling me after i have paid i ask for extra carmel on my latte but noooooo,1

top and tiny,1
not extraordinary,1
semaine avant,1
difficult to find seating after 10,1
hilariously big,1
surprised to see that cafe ba ba reeba had a lower average rating than firefly on paradise,1

cheap and gross,1
soft and stale,1
a bit too playfull,1
hot as hades,1
third and probably,1
glad dog owners have a place to go if they want,1

well owned,1
just nice,1
stupid entitled,1
only hard,1
all super attentive,1
lucky to live nearby,1

quite surprised to find great chinese food hidden in downtown medina ohio,1
enjoyable for me,1
a little high in my opinion,1
willing to lose in order to still eat the sushi,1
one server short,1
a depressing,1
part border collie,1
very vocal,1
nice to see a massive heap of fresh fruit come with your meal as opposed to more potatoes more buttered bread or more bacon,1
hard to make any decision at all,1
decent not amazing,1

wrong with baking in the toppings,1
dumb and rude,1

almost reminicent of a creamsicle,1
drop dead,1
able to walk right up to the stage,1
pushy or annoying,1
wrong with goat cheese tomato sauce and bread,1
way too overpowering,1
another chance with him,1
born and white,1
always delish,1
sure if the masseuse was certified for pregnant massages,1

clean and shiny in there too,1
one available,1
highly impressed with his professionalism and knowledge,1
very relaxing and professional,1
back to the counter untouched to get a refund,1
even easier,1
so happy she suggested it,1
due to poor training rather than lack of personal effort on her part,1
salty and lukewarm,1
annoyed to have been disturbed from running his mouth with members of his staff,1
insane without it,1
awesome and all,1
happy with a tired pup,1
pretty attentive,1

overly laden with sugar salt or msg,1
so picky about my soup,1
big on buffets,1
completely tortured,1

a little sick,1
much else to type anything more,1
usually less,1
less trendy,1
bored one,1
bought at the bakery at a grocery storethey we asked again why we could not get the pink sprinkles,1
surprisingly good inexpensive,1
good though can not say about the customer service,1
local in noda from abari to cabo fish,1
interested in learning about the bar,1
much to brag about,1
so low priced,1
helpful with refilling drinks clearing dishes from the table,1
pretty plain with mayo tomatoes and avacado,1

good or great,1
picky about my sushi,1
glad i passed,1

fantastically memorable,1
new enjoyable,1
phenomenal sounding,1
disappointing as the bland eggrolls,1

right in the middle in front of you,1
pretty extensive with specialty drinks,1
awesome and fun,1
a little too helpful,1
incredibly odd,1
sure you are not seated by the waterfall,1

crazy good,1
well proportioned,1
a lil different,1
impressed enough to write a review until last night,1
able to get my pup out,1
tired out at dog bar,1

pretty aggressive towards him,1
too worried because of my dog,1
so comforting and helpful,1
well worth stopping in for,1

every day run of the mill basic,1
fancy or particularly,1
sick from food,1
intentionally rude,1
clearly overwhelmed and inefficient,1
the american,1
cold and rubbery and dry,1
deathly sick right after eating it and for the rest of the day,1
too many other food options to go to,1
bar none better,1
proof enough,1
generally dirty,1
environmental great,1
extremely bad and unpleasant,1
careful how much you,1
too cakey for me,1
wrong with any menu item,1
cool comfortable and tasteful,1
very popular in the near future with the development of the langtree area,1
worth the scramble for the food,1
our service superb,1
seemingly odd,1
delightfully drunken,1
egg related,1
authentic as,1
upscale casual,1
unfamiliar to a lot of people in the area,1
familiar with the neopolitan concept,1
so glad they did,1
a little concerned over the menu not having a large selection of items and many of the people in our party,1
unable to keep up with refiling of beverages,1
fine for a breakfast joint,1
excited to know that we were going to have a tapas place,1
equal mexican,1
famous for their coffee and every other place,1
less than pleasant,1
difficult to relax,1
very awkward and uncomfortable,1
very annoying to drop 65 on a mani pedi only to get home,1
totally impressed,1
helpful and prompt,1
freshly baked right before you,1
4 5 star worthy,1
desperate for some food,1
tasty unique,1
really late,1

ready to stand in line,1
ready and willing,1
incredibly courteous,1
hygienic as they make you believe,1
big and small,1
rambunctious and calm,1
extremely disappointed by this tapas bar,1
absolutely amazing and refreshing,1
much more energized yet calm after each session,1
out of something else,1
self nice,1
favorite out of all charlotte clubs,1
fun young,1
totally sobering,1
very relaxing and enjoyable,1
easy to make a reservation,1
definitely acceptable,1
no rice available at the moment,1
big and thick,1
overcooked and tough,1
so glad we did and we will definitely be back on another trip i had the all star breakfast with raisin toast and grits i have never had grits before but very,1
very friendly and welcoming thank you for a great experience and yummy food,1

necessary to speak to the manager jim,1
great for sporting events,1
chronically slow,1
tough a hybrid,1
far thicker,1
chinese mongolian japanese,1
typical of any place that offers all three,1
heavily breaded,1
easy to schedule an appointment,1

great plum spicy,1
greasy at all and fresh veggies,1
lighter and fresher,1

simple and beautiful,1
very good it was mozzarella which they make in house basil and some meat,1
pretty tall,1
sad that they were closed or so long,1
so happy to hear they reopened so i can enjoy my large chicken strips sub with ranch on the side,1

a bit stingy,1
bad at all for what we ordered,1
ready to sing along dance or just bob your drunken head to the music,1
quick with the clean,1

not very impressed,1
just overall cool,1
very consistent with their taste and quality,1
very orangey,1

available in the bar and the personal dining area,1
not a bad,1

awe inspiring,1
disappointing and irritating,1
long as my previous experiences,1
busy nor hectic,1
near spectacular or exciting,1
sour and spicy,1
way too understaffed,1
at least satisfied with what you paid for,1
super hard,1
first first friday,1
very glad to have been introduced to this hip comfortable modern bar,1
much more cramped,1
spacious with appropriate lighting and plenty of seating,1
seemingly sophisticated,1
lounge like,1

a bit overdone,1
uber salty,1
environmentally conscious,1
horrible do not waste your money,1

not hard to deep fry potatoes and order curds in from quebec,1
so so bland,1
very adult,1
so cool and happy,1
extra pissed at this bc it would have never happened back home in chicago,1
wayyyy overpriced,1
tipsy at the bar right outside the entrance,1
attentive and timely,1
excellent as was the steak ordered by the fourth in our party,1
substantial in the halibut dish,1
wonderful as was the creme brulee with berries,1
very very cheery,1
hesitant to give them another shot,1
full until dinner,1
a little too messy,1
comparable to other waffle house restaurants,1
the most welcoming,1
sad to see that there was seemingly only one employee working both the counter and dining area,1
sort of busy,1
ideal for those looking to have a fun yet,1
happy hour from 1 8,1
small cramped,1
double fisted,1
hungry for wings,1
so magically pungent,1
thick as 2x4 s,1
akin to a portuguese roll,1
temporarily worthy,1
loud guitar driven,1
not too many,1
clean and quite,1
cold with cheese crackers and mini corn dogs,1
excited to try out the edge steakhouse located inside the westgate in which we were staying,1

able to snag a seat,1
family oriented,1
excellent quick,1
more light and refreshing,1
fresh healthy and delicious,1
very colourful and cool,1
flame broiled,1
interested in trying the beef,1

not afraid to pile it on,1
all nice and hot,1
so massive,1
fairly sure,1
large enough to satisfy me for three complete meals,1
awesome for 5,1

overpriced they fare with other buffets,1
sooo much food neatly wrapped up in the oversize tortilla lrb burrito rrb that i could not wait to dig in,1
quite impressed with the way the cashier was handling the crowd,1
quite gracious,1
full by the time they do,1
never horrible,1
never great,1
glad we finally have a decent cafe in the area,1
beautiful in here,1
good for lunch or dinner,1
lucky enough to have it made by one of the many tattooed men,1
nothing artisan or fancy about it,1
better off stopping at a high school band car wash,1
simple in nature,1
hard to finish a large by myself which at 699 1000 is an excellent value,1
family kid friendly,1
super strong and tasty,1
so chewy,1
very fresh and crisp,1
hard to find since it is at 17th ave,1
much about the waffle,1
very convenient for me,1

soo frustrated,1
poor or cheap,1
very happy to see when there are plenty of vegetarian options,1
tasty as hell,1

true to life find,1
more than enough for each of us,1
a tad more plentiful and squeaky,1
mixed with the veg,1
as crowded,1
korean vietnamese,1

fast and busy,1
super psyched,1
so happy to know about this place,1
pretty huge for ayce,1
generally very busy,1
pretty noisy,1
very inconsiderate of our financial loss,1
modern like the ayrsley location,1
less than pristine,1
good to curve drunks,1
all i would hoped for,1
bar traditional american,1
busy normal,1
very rustic,1
meat roasted,1
baked in tomato sauce,1
amazingly tender and moist,1

close to talking stick arena and the phoenix convention center,1
so trendy,1
soggy and greasy,1
hard and fatty,1
rather large and open,1
unpretentious and knowledgeable,1
close to 40 taps i believe always rotating,1
really thin with her,1
needless to say the food,1
completely shtty,1
responsible for tables at the opposite end of the restaurant,1
nice to have a table to sit at all tables were not bussed,1
off filled w crumbs or grease,1
eerily similar,1
only one thing different,1
hot enough to melt the cheese,1
willing to give them another try on a future trip to calgary,1

naturally raised,1
micro roasted,1
direct or fair,1
infinitely patient on this first busy day,1
super excited to try this location out as well,1
remarkably cheery and amiable,1

remotely low,1
very heavy of lard or whatever they use to cook everything in,1
slightly ill,1
all star special with a pecan,1
common at these joints,1
most chinese,1
very very generous,1
pretty darn tasty,1
first or second,1
more than willing to try them again due to the lovely pastries and the smiles,1
hard to walk and then see they gave me,1
alright for the price you pay,1
quite surprised to find my car still had not come through and there were no cars or people there,1
right off the bat,1
quite irritated and upset,1
baffling and perplexing,1
good for lunch delivery,1
almost offensive to eat,1
okay but not exceptional,1
amazed by how much i got,1
so welcoming and nice,1
high in sugar,1
good as any,1
pretty much melted in my mouth,1
generally great,1
as great as when i have previously had their food,1
unable to give us a time for the shuttle,1
absolutely refreshing,1
able to enjoy it anywhere else,1

sleek and sexy,1
dumpling overall,1
surprised to see how reasonable to prices were great lunch specials,1
so excited to try this place,1

very dismissive,1
awesome with her customer service skills,1
available at lunch,1
straight out,1
crazy friendly,1
sure i would want to head here into the evening because while the art on the wall by local artisans lend to the urban hip feel the cash for gold type places across the street do not have the same je ne cest quoi,1
overly helpful,1
pretty good as were the beans and rice lrb with salsa from their salsa bar of course rrb,1
nice because its private,1
bad letting my son eat that garbage for dinner,1
again gross,1
old all packed up,1
ready for a wait,1
interesting and wide,1
cheerful and pleasant,1
hush puppies and cajun tartar,1
happy to hear they have motown jamming in the background too,1
a bit sketchy,1
orange and green tiled,1
hush puppies and a chicken,1
k taco plate,1
hush puppy,1
soft oozy,1
sick after eating here,1
clear of the clams,1
thai and chinese,1
too large for them,1
really lousy,1
worth about 500,1
too terrible,1
satisfied with,1
able to go when grandma is cooking it really,1
seriously ginormous,1
delish too,1
quite dark,1
difficult to see your food properly,1
able to see it if it is cooked properly or if the kitchen crew may have personally customized your food without your knowledge,1
good for two people,1
not even warm,1
too strong in sweetness,1
inexpensive delicious and right,1
fresh with a light crispy crust,1
sour and sweet,1
big and full,1
exactly professional or appetizing,1
really busy in there,1
friendly and lively,1
so big i could only finish half of it for lunch,1
neat for them,1
good with friendly service,1
the shrimp based,1
too close for comfort,1
conducive to the customer enjoying their meal,1
small intimate,1
good music,1
slightly crisp,1
golden brown,1
again kind of bland,1
super big for one person,1
close to major freeway,1

tired of the club,1
well enough to keep you coming back for more,1
rather loud,1
very very lovely,1
most italian,1
garlicky and olive oily,1
magically not acidic,1
very very hearty,1
almost heavy the pastas are,1
squeamish about seeing a puddle of oil at the bottom of their plate this,1
very herbal,1
delightfully thick,1
too full to have it right away,1
dense and chocolatey and sweet,1
quite pleasant and patient,1
too bleh,1
craving quick,1
surprised only one person mentioned the achiote chicken salad,1
close and convenient,1
super garlic y,1
really greasy,1
bright yellow,1
too appealing,1
not nickle,1
excited to explore the new wp opening downtown,1
music awesome,1
waaaaayyyy too long,1
good fun,1
well mixed and lively,1
through yet never mushy,1
good its the shrimp,1
alone to which he replied in his new yawk accent,1
very handsome,1
delicious 7,1
petit filet with a side of mushrooms,1
way more delicious,1
oily for my taste,1
ok for a i do not want to cook,1
underwhelming after the excellent lasagne,1
warm too,1
cozy warm,1
quick and prompt,1
so involved in his investment,1
too lean,1
crazy fast,1
too damn dark in there,1
good enough to get to everyone on time,1
the money with a tip larger,1
easy to get into,1
more busy,1
free to get into,1
typical of any club music you heard,1
extremely fun and outgoing,1
very dimly lit with dark corners for dark deeds,1
poshly decorated,1
happy with the fast forward button,1
perfect for the two of us,1
slightly heavier,1
nice to have some variety and competition,1
open after they were done,1
occasionally long,1
beer battered,1
fairly neat,1
seemingly every,1
fun to see the whole thing,1
funny to see them picking up all the nuances of the waffle house,1
thi yellow or red,1
so hubby,1
not very friendly,1
more inclined to go when there is a game on all the tvs and for drinks not food,1
popular 7 numbers,1
afraid to have an extra glass of wine eat your entire basket of bread or order more than one pasta,1
unrivaled by any,1
almost philanthropic in a way,1
true to your italian roots,1
sure so will our other 100 guests,1
too slimy,1
quite dark in here,1
nice to find a place to sit and relax and have a drink in vegas,1
complete with some awkward quilted round,1
skinny hard,1
really difficult for this missouri girl,1
ridiculous for the quality of food,1
basic and familiar,1
very easy to make as long as you call two weeks in advance,1
able to book tables when bringing groups to watch sports events,1
close to this location,1
most likely the owner s 5 6 year,1
rapidly annoying,1
even possible,1
maybe 34 full,1
really less,1
really nice and talkative,1
similar to the sweet escape from wild wings,1
hot off the grill,1
very wet,1
not at all clean,1
thin cold and rubbery,1
extremely busy at lunch time,1
overwhelming like some places are,1
a little disappointed not to be going home that night,1
at least happy they put us up in a nice hotel,1
en route,1
full for the night,1
clear of their terrible service,1
american mexican and white,1
both hungry,1
friendly and sincere,1
laden with the mains plus sides,1
so full up,1
unique and tasty,1
tender and enough,1
wonderfully layered,1
enriched in a delicious tomato sauce,1
melt in the mouth,1
too salty to enjoy,1
surprisingly big container similar,1
little rough around,1
wholesome good value,1
perfect for a cosy night,1
fast simple,1
pretty boring,1
so dedicated to my job,1
basically amazing,1
extremely succulent,1
hard to beat jamburritos so try them out,1

pretty chill cool,1
great honest,1
light crisp,1
able to find decent food,1
lukewarm sweet and sour,1
especially indecisive,1

unlucky to get food poisoning from eating their buns mind you,1
lacking and slow,1
simple and authentic,1
on busy,1
very reasonable for the quality of ingredients,1
all super tasty,1
only annoying,1
cold greasy and thin,1
truly relaxing,1
similar to el pollo loco or something,1
presently surprised,1

quick and amazing,1
ok good,1
pretty sure he is the only guy there,1
really good to go,1
often hit,1
fun to explore,1
needless to say that we had an amazing dining experience,1
chef steve young,1
nice to stop by and ask us,1
interested in trying the wagyu beef or the braised short ribs,1
little indian,1
more than enough for two people and a quick inexpensive meal,1
really very good,1
pleased to be the only patrons in the establishment at 4 pm on a thursday,1
happy with the cheap eats and friendly service,1
fresh by rotating their offerings,1
quite impressed with what i encountered,1
spacious elongated,1
sweet and meaty,1
a classic ceramic lion headed,1
nicely seasoned and buttery,1
dipped in buerre,1
ordered baked,1
complete without a memorable dessert,1
all friendly and helpful,1
definitely decorative,1
cozy sociable and great,1
almost impossible to mess it,1
quite unappetizing,1
just not attractive,1
appetizing at all,1
not too watery,1
much better off,1
right with that attitude,1
very unimpressive,1
very italian with 4 courses,1
too special about their poutine except the fact,1
a bit crispier,1
that hungry,1
poutine head straight,1
so happy with our experience,1
exceptionally so,1
polite charming and attentive,1
intrusive or overbearing,1
especially kind and welcoming,1
great overall,1
bored with the chains set menus,1
evilly delicious,1

fairly nicely decorated,1
orange chicken bacon wrapped,1
amazingly warm,1
as good as it,1
seaweed salad awsome,1
slightly intended,1
good for being treated differently for the way,1
fragrant and delightful,1
overwhelming do not worry,1
trivial pursuit or hungry,1
quick to serve you,1

glad we stopped here,1
so good for sports,1
a disgrace to the service industry,1
nearly empty although to sit at any of the empty tables,1
disgusted with how we were treated,1
ready to spend a lot of money,1
glad they did not let us get the bottle service even though we were going to when we first arrived,1
a little worse,1
at best average,1
so sad the first owners moved away,1

pretty good for a chain,1
char to it,1
generous for a chain,1

great but not terrible,1
high b,1
really unprofessional about everything,1
a bit somewhat slow,1
very attentive and fast,1
more cajun,1
sure to stop by,1

due to the attitude of a couple of attendants,1
often angry,1
a bit antiquated,1
cheap during happy hour,1
still very reasonable,1
able to stop by and get some take out,1

just fine for my 48 hour buffalo,1
perfectly tender,1
baked in i do not know,1
creamy and cheesy and delicious,1
too good to have been anything else,1
very thin and watery,1

obvious that that the bartenders were lost,1
not paying,1

happy i did not listen to some of the reviews,1
so fresh hot and full,1
pretty rare in toronto,1
always crowded and overpriced,1
most attractive,1
a bit too big,1
right around 1230,1
able to stay anyways as the bebe was fussing,1
able to incorporate the phrase sausage fest into our brief conversations,1
limp mushy and flavorless,1
enough to almost cut the inside of my mouth,1
cold i guess,1
great to support a small local shop,1
perfectly fluffy,1
super flavourful,1
far less hectic,1
beautiful in there,1
six year old,1
open to the public,1
very dim,1
similar to that of downtown cocktail room,1
red to reflect the color on to any drink sitting on the table,1
almost ottoman like bar,1
nice chill,1
soft as butter,1
absurdly priced,1
greasy and fantastic,1
cozy comforting,1
not overly so furniture,1
more casual,1
surprisingly lackluster,1
not to like about this place,1
edging and great,1
neither friendly or offensive,1
next to the elevator,1
sure as rain falls from the sky upon checking in i,1
delighted for free drinks,1
worth staying in that depressing place,1
less than favorable,1
good sweet,1
grand at the tables,1
obligated to give that money right back to the house by paying 500 per bottle for alcohol,1
enough to compete for the waitresses,1
willing to spend a grand or two on bottle service skip this place,1
decent for the first hour,1
thoroughly pleased with my first visit,1
double smoked,1
friendly and wonderful,1
a little meltier,1
more than pleased to head back to big cheese and sample some of their many many other poutines,1
joyed there is a place for coffee in his hood other than a coffee time or the coffee machine at the laundromat,1
mega cute,1
cow themed,1
amazingly tasty and refreshing,1
meat free,1
wrong with this cozy hangout spot,1
friendly filibertos with a salsa bar and higher prices,1
much of a surprise,1
likely out of a tray,1
quick hey go,1
wrong with a battleship,1
sure how much of a chain this place is,1
heavy with the sauce,1
usually overwhelming,1
very large in size which could be a plus for those looking for more for their money,1
baked on food on your utensils or lipstick stains on your tea,1
clean organized,1

fairly new in town,1
clean and beautiful,1
very meticulous,1
comfortable and happy,1
equally enjoyable,1
so thankful that i have finally found a place that gives their clients the exceptional service that they deserve,1

absolutely worst,1
so mad we kind of sorta went off on them,1
mad and hungry,1
able to get the orange chicken lunch special and a drink for a little under 8,1
too plain,1
devoid of any taste at all,1
fair to rate,1
the sporting life 10k,1
typical food counter experience just like other banh mi boys,1
favourite banh mi from them ringing in at 750,1
lucky to have been taken somewhere,1
interested in trying more mexican restaurants,1
three hard,1
close to the freeway,1

rare and delicious,1
as strong of a dr pepper taste,1
good enough to make me want to try them next time,1
too bad this place is kind of tucked away,1
severly understaffed,1
so happy to have such a cool place,1
at that low,1
knowledgeable enough to review a poutine place,1
a bit peppery,1
too tough to stick a fork into,1
no table available,1
so as the wine,1
slightly salty for my taste,1
ok too,1
very good in toronto,1
much better than anything,1
too young,1
too drunk,1
more dynamic,1
dance filled,1
more delicious,1
ridiculously great,1
100 warranted,1
bad to write home about here,1
happy too,1

handwritten on the chalkboards,1
many of which,1
authentic italian,1
these cheesy dishes of potato gravy goodness fall into 5 different categories traditional,1
authentic scottish,1
authentically seasoned,1
the bar nice,1
relatively comfortable,1
out of stock of everything,1
able to get the hotel shuttle to come and pick us up on the way back,1
dirty down to the dishes,1
most tender and delicious,1
very knowledgeable about everything on the menu,1
very helpful and sweet,1
more than enough for lunch,1
perfect with a great blend of seasoning,1
lacking huge,1
pleasantly full,1
not saucy enough,1
surprisingly slightly tough,1
soft she will but tasted more like a roti kind of style,1
well worth the price,1
truly impressed,1
afraid it would not be enough food,1
lovely and light,1
hard to hear each other talk,1
delicious as was the gravy,1
very big filling,1
even edible,1
close to the airport and near several dining establishments and bars,1
so noticeable,1
worst and slowest,1
new and exciting,1
so close to all the cool spots,1
but loud and warm,1
very well executed,1
spicy roasted,1
fast and effortless,1
clear from looking at the servers that they had some repeat customers,1

expensive 2200 for the works wash i usually pay 1700 or 1800 for the same thing other places,1
just cleaned,1
incredibly cold in there,1
uncomfortably chilly,1
cold disgusting,1
plush modern,1
55 year old,1
old enough to be your dad,1
necessary to give this place just one star lrb as opposed to two rrb,1
somewhat short,1
infamous for its legendary jamburrito,1
left full,1
satisfied because of the cajun flavors and portions,1
721 n central,1
crowded as others i have been to in vegas,1
sure we had a great meal and time,1
absolutely sensational,1
practically empty on sunday night,1
early or late,1

busy and delicious,1
surprised to see that i have never had banh mi boys before,1
mostly bad,1
even for vegetarians vegans,1
soo delish,1
consistently high,1
carefully prepared,1
able to cut in line pay lrb 1475 rrb and be off to have our picnic,1
immediately apparent,1
sufficient but not overwhelming,1
unable to finish his,1
very impressed with the quality of the battleship,1
full for a subsequent long ish walk in the park,1
sure to try a battleship,1
wrong with a triangle battleship,1
a lot busier,1
hard and rubbery,1
crappy worst experience ever what was supposed to been an enjoyable evening with two graduates turned into a crappy night plain,1
simple do not go there if you expect decent service because you will not get it,1
ever due,1
a bit high for a restaurant of this caliber,1
serious about his craft,1
fun to have a little play area for them to stay occupied,1
nice to see a place like this near yonge eglington,1
so glad that i chose this place because i got to put our evening on cruise control,1
super easy to please,1

visibly frustrated,1
way too dry,1
quick and super,1
incredibly juicy,1
wonderful for someone with celiac,1
impressed by her paying more attention to here text messages than her customers,1
ready as it cost me 250 plus 300 bank fee to get money out,1
very bare,1
perfect for a neighborhood sandwich shop,1
different than any other italian restaurant i have eaten at in the city,1
dimly lit with only candle light,1
uncomfortable at all,1
very sweet and friendly,1
careful not to become to attached to certain dishes,1
too big on desserts,1
sure it is him behind the bar,1
even ripe,1
not concerned about guests,1
super weird,1
one free lrb during weekdays rrb,1
a free,1
very cabiney,1
cute and clean,1
ever pedi,1
open until 11 pm six days of the week,1
lrb vegetarian rrb,1
disappointed that my gel polish chipped and peeled after only two weeks,1
not sure if it is their application process or the quality of their products,1
incredibly flakey,1
friendly relaxed staff and all,1
ethically raised,1
unwilling to budge on the price or correct the work,1
clear it had not been done thoroughly,1
extremely disappointing,1
amazing tasty,1
back to the whole hotel room smelling like waffle house but not in a good maple syrup,1
very famous,1
tasty a bit,1
pricey for some people,1
sexy and classy,1
perfect for canoodling anything more,1
extremely beautiful,1
nice to see the nice atrium as i was going to the sixth floor,1

very crowded on a sunday afternoon,1
really hard to disappoint a drunk,1
legit fancy,1
extremely brown,1
cold because of the fire,1
super far up,1
very attentive with the specific color i wanted,1
great but not outstanding,1
pretty melted,1
truly fantastic,1
next to no banana peppers in it,1
super off to me,1
sort of claustrophobic,1
so respectful and nice,1
a delicious,1
hard to believe that a place like triangle bar and grill only has 8 reviews,1
enough for some,1
happy to make me a sandwich,1
amazing and soft,1
close able,1
perfect for a family or multiple occupancy,1
super friendly and welcoming,1
a bit higher than other buffets,1
able to leave china city super buffet behind after i left,1
so dirty and grimy,1
rude as heck,1
possible to chill or browse what,1
stuck blowing 20 25 across multiple trucks to not starve,1
soft fluffy and worth,1

ridiculously amused by having one,1
super exellent,1
enough on their own,1
ok food,1

quite curious as to what the 750 lrb rrb portion looks like,1
curious enough,1
slightly salty,1
modest sized,1
sorry to whoever received them after,1
interested in cake,1
wonderful about cleaning out the ashtrays regularly,1
scared of places where the bouncers only pick the pretty people,1
too partied out from the previous day night,1
good for dinner,1
outstanding and hustling,1
blown out,1
severely damaged,1
sure they assume we gave up,1
just happy,1
so vibrant,1
greasy and good,1
nice and unexpected,1
usually pleasant,1

classy and small,1
great cozy,1
able to hear what anyone has to say,1

very tasty delicious,1
clear enough to show that,1
just a few weeks agoi,1
too bad for me,1
outstanding making it,1
fun and interesting,1
hour priced,1
very edgey and rich,1
about 10,1
credibly well to reasonable locals with young families,1
manifest political,1
intimate and great,1
willing to work with you,1
sure you order a juice lrb like pineapple juice rrb,1
overly complicated,1
so impressed we are now contemplating becoming jamburrito stalkers,1
present with my card,1
baked for,1
so impoverished,1
hard to feel like i am enjoying a reprieve from the hustle,1
popular with me and my lunch clique,1
fast cheap pretty good,1
perfect for a postlunch stop when we want to kill more time before heading back to the office,1
partial to the pico de gallo,1
sure you come here to get you a battleship,1
sure to check this place out if you have not already,1
familiar with npl,1
and a bit lighter,1
hard to get the bartenders attention,1
ok but not worth,1
spicy and good,1
so easy to rack up a bigger bill than if you just ordere dthe family dinner option,1
a little gross on the way,1
spicy pea,1
good to share,1
yet very tasty,1
very friendly and fun,1
delish and fresh,1
the prices reasonable,1
absolutely wonderful and friendly,1
wonderfully long,1
full waxing services,1
disgusted at the treatment they received,1
very slow in taking their order,1
much for their money,1
completely unimpressed,1
rife with old refrigerator,1
sure the bar is a good time,1
hot at all,1
nice but not efficient,1
so hot out,1
disgusting most of the time granted after a brief negotiation she paid 400 for a total once over,1
2 expensive,1
very standard in selection,1
wrong with the food,1
able to stay to get the detail because i had an appointment to make,1
about to wait another two hours for it to get done,1
so lucky i did not flip out on him,1
obvious shocked,1
quite apparent,1
long especially after the first batch of wings,1
very fussy about how my nails are cared for,1
ok before going to the next step,1
petty at least once a month,1
open monday through saturday,1
very upset over the crap,1
less than thrilled,1
not stellar,1
bubbly and pleasant,1
a bit different than the first time,1
skeptical about having dinner here and spending the money with all the other restaurants on the strip,1
glass holding,1
completely open to the restaurant,1
especially surprising,1
red to enhance the dining,1
close to my new apartment,1
as good as this one,1
able to accommodate on short notice,1
fast and convenient,1
small overpriced cold and gross,1
oily and dirty,1
otherwise horrible,1
so many better,1
highly overrated,1
happy as hell to find this flavor hiding around here,1
bar food with nothing outstanding,1
exceptional but ok,1
thick stick like,1
illegal in other states,1
close one eye,1
strictly enforced,1
extremely crunchy,1

pretty diverse,1
food lousy,1
surprisingly different,1
better frozen,1
very detailed,1
nice relaxing,1
definitely not fresh,1
not obnoxious,1
enough of a selection for the kids,1
great for me,1
very rich and satisfying,1
quite minimal,1
consistant with that order,1
kind of,1
big on writing reviews,1
supportive of local businesses and restaurants,1
sure you do not want the health inspector breathing down your neck,1
almost green,1
typical of chinese dishes,1
a little more poppin,1
really good all the good new songs were playing,1
good with exception of one lady who always seems to have a sour look on her face,1
about as comfortable,1
able to ring water out of my carpets lrb after 3 whole days rrb,1
very tasty from what i recall,1
nice they let you put pay a little extra and try a few,1
so good we ordered more,1
famous for their popovers,1
better than any bread basket,1
very danceable,1
so danceable,1
so grand,1
food truck galore,1
kind of salty,1
glad there was a good proportion of rice and meat,1
sure if it would have matter if there was cheese or not,1
incredibly friendly and nice,1
great from every employee we talked to,1
way better than chain pizza places,1
quick friendly,1
pricey but well worth,1
early in the day,1
anywhere else called,1
so flavourful and delicious,1
incredible i stay at plenty of hotels with a continental breakfast,1
adjacent to one of the corner rooms,1
sensitive to noise,1
able to give this cute independent eatery 5 stars,1
full by the time the next batch comes,1
quite large i expected more of a snack size,1
literally 3 feet long,1
just the right amount of veggies and meat,1
extremely disturbing,1
full of someone is used shower water,1
a bit dramatic on the train,1
not a good,1
super nice to actually enjoy clean air while getting my nails done hahaah,1
great for a quick slice a meal or for some party food,1
sadly bare,1
very convient,1
next to several shopping centers,1
all just exceptional,1
dark golden brown,1
outstanding with a little ketchup and or mayo,1
annoying as the bland,1
juicy seared,1
pretty worried,1
perfect for my daughters,1
acceptable for anyone,1

short of eating salt directly from the shaker,1
amazing though,1
incredible happy,1

surprised i pulled it off,1
not trippin,1

comical but not enough,1
wise 45,1
similar to it,1
very slow on a thursday short staff,1
very glad we did,1
a little pricey for its portion,1
more winning,1
needless to say what we had we loved,1
near ready to order something when i saw what the person in front of me got,1
addicted to mac and cheese in all forms so to see my favorite thing in life on top of a poutine my heart skipped a beat,1
hot and gooey,1
cheesy hot and fresh,1
brown and crispy and hot,1

able to use this range,1
hot hot,1
completely undigestsble,1
very strict on all you can eat,1
very strict i could not even give my friends a piece of the sushi,1
compelled to give it a go,1
fully obsessed with this place,1
complete with our own tziki,1
too hard to chew,1
awful and dry,1
great after,1
this new,1
aprox 45 min,1
short staffed that day,1
hard to find a halal restaurant that has both good food and good ambiance to sit in,1
spicy soft,1
impressed by the details,1
quite impressed by the pizza they serve,1
quite appetising,1
generous with the toppings they give,1
just too snotty,1
a little frustrating with this particular visit was a few items,1
actually available,1
other than that little bump in the road this was an okay visit with decent customer service,1
either old,1
well chosen,1
oily for whatever reason,1
inaccurate and sparse,1
very friendly and up,1
too salty for my taste,1

upset about their shrimp tempura,1
fair at all only sushi place,1
a little bit low,1
fantastic turkish,1
incredibly thrilled,1
so very warm and hospitable,1

sure about the differences between the courses of treatment,1
about fun at work,1
considerate of your customers time team members,1
pricey for the low quality,1

generally packed,1
fortunate to spot the hotels owner charles khabouth just walking around checking how the crowd is at the restaurant,1
busy to the point there was not much room to stand or sit at the bar either,1
wrong with any selection on the menu,1
how much of each item,1
partly due to the fact,1
shocked and awed,1
possible to make a yam tempura roll seeing since they have all the ingredients,1
very long and tedious,1
a little weary at first,1
critical on sushi,1
